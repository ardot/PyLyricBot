Yeah, this the real one baby,
Uh, Chi town stand up,
South side, south side,
We gon' set this party off right,
West side, west side,
We gon' set this party off right.
Man I promise, she's so self conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecure
The concept of school seems so secure
Sophomore three years aint picked a career
She like fuck it, I'll just stay down here and do hair
Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus (a Lexus)
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well
Uh, and when it falls down who you gon' call now?
C'mon c'mon, and when it fall's down
Man I promise, I'm so self conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pasha's they done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this!
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the American dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe
Uh, and when it falls down who you gon' call now?
C'mon c'mon, and when it fall's down
I say fuck the police, that's how I treat em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes but we don't really need em
The things we buy to cover up what's inside
Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorties holler, "Where the ballers at?"
Drug dealers buy Jordans, crackheads buy crack
But the white man get paid off of all a dat
But I ain't even gon act holier than thou
Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz
I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spending before I get it
We all self conscious I'm just the first to admit it
Uh, and when it falls down who you gon' call now?
C'mon c'mon, and when it fall's down,
South side, south side,
We gon' set this party off right,
West side, west side,
We gon' set this party off right.
Chi-Town, Chi-Town,
We gon' show em how we get down.
Hustling ain't easy, it's like a safe belt,
Save my life, c'mon.
My raps is better than yours 
My plaques is better than yours 
My tracks is better than yours 
You can have one but I have to charge 
We can start with the hits on my arm I already got the bomb 
Now all I need is my first LP to go gold 
Then I will have the qualm, I-I-I-I'm 
I'm Kan the Louis Vuitton Don 
Bought my mom a purse now she Louis Vuitton Mom 
Still might throw on a little low arm they want me to stop go on go on 
They don't want me to shop and me spending that hard 
Oh my God is that a black card? 
I turned around and replied why yes, 
But I prefer the term African-American Express 
Brains, power and muscle like Dame, Puffy and Russell 
Your boy back on his hustle, don't know you don't discuss you 
Every rapper want to know when they can get to work 
Every stylist want to know where they can get the shirts 
Everybody ripping my style like the shit that hurts 
But they don't give me my credit that's the shit that hurts 
There's something I might say, There's something I might play 
A beat I might make might make they life change 
And save their whole deal, Their wrist is on chill 
They house is on hill, You could be Lauren Hill 
See y'all write songs to keep the lights on 
I'ma go in Def Jam and turn the brights on 
Man I'm just sayin 
When I wanted to rap y'all thought I was just playin 
Now you just prayin 
Ha ha we in this bitch 
It's Common and Kanye y'all niggaz know what time it is 
Chi-Town motherfuckers DJ Ferris Heavy Hitters What Up?

That's all
See what I want so much, should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God talk to me now, this is an emergency
And she claim she only with me for the currency
You cut me deep bitch, cut me like surgery
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurting me
I'd never do that to you, at least purposely
We breaking up again, we making up again
But we don't love no more, I guess we fucking then
Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her?
And you mix them emotions with tequila
And you mix that with a little bad advice
On one of them bad nights, ya'll have a bad fight
And you talking 'bout her family, her aunts and shit
And she say "Motherfucker, yo momma's a bitch!"
You know, domestic drama and shit, all that attitude
I'll never hit a girl, but I'll shake the shit outta you!
But I'mma be the bigger man, Big Pimpin' like Jiggaman
Oh I guess I figure it's...
See what I want so much, should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God talk to me now, this is an emergency
And my nigga said I shouldn't let it worry me
I need to focus on the girls we getting currently
But I been thinking and it got me back to sinking and
This relationship it even got me back to drinking all this
Hennessy
It's gonna be the death of me
And I always thought that you having my child was our destiny
But I can't even vibe with you sexually
Cuz every time I would try, you would question me
Saying "You fucking them girls, disrespecting me?
You don't see how ya lies is affecting me.
You don't see how our life was supposed to be.
And I never let a nigga get that close to me.
And you ain't cracked up to what you was supposed to be.
You always gone, you'll always be where them hoes'll be."
And this the first time she ever spilled her soul to me
I fucked up and I know it g
I guess it's bittersweet poetry
See what I want so much, should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God talk to me now, this is an emergency
From my theme song
My leather black jeans on
My by any means on
Pardon me gettin' my scream on
Enter the kingdom
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
And at the top door they gon come at you King Kong
Middle America packed in
Came to see me in my black skin
My homey was number one draft pick
They slip on his jersey and act rich
If I don't get ran out by Catholics
Here come some conservative Baptists
Sayin he overreactin'
Like them black kids in Chiraq bitch
4in the morning, and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where's the trojans?
Picture me livin' in the moment
And I've been a menace for the longest
Picture me livin' in the moment
Picture me livin' in the moment
So follow me up cause this shit's about to go down
I'm doin' 500, I'm outta control now
But there's nowhere to go, now
And there's no way to slow down
Runnin' out of time - moving fast
So just close your eyes and then enjoy this crash
4 in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
Think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 girls, they're the chosen
Baby we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it
Stop all that goon shit
Early morning cartoon shit
This is goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb bitch
Back out the room bitch
Stop all that goon shit
These niggas ain't doin' shit
These niggas ain't doin' shit
What do you say to a masked man
This Inglorious Bastard that's rappin'
We might have to burn this whole suit down,
Like the theater that Hitler was trapped in
 in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
 Think I'm possessed, it's an omen
 300 girls, and we're throwin'
 300 girls, and they're zonin'
 Baby we're livin' in the moment
 Baby we're livin' in the moment
 Keep it goin', keep it goin'
 Let's play the blame game, I love you, more
 Let's play the blame game for sure.
 Let's call her names, names, I hate you, more.
 Let's call her names, names, for sure.
 I'll call you bitch for sure
 As a last resort, and my first resort
 You call me motherf-cker for long,
 At the end of it you know we both were wrong.
 But I love to play the blame game, I love you more.
 Let's play the blame game for sure.
 Let's call her names, names, I hate you, more.
 Let's call her names, names, for sure.
 On a bathroom wall I wrote
 "I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else" (else, else, else)
 I took a piss and dismiss it and went and found somebody else
 Arguing harvesting the feelings, I'd rather be by my f-cking self
 Till about 2am and I call back and I hang up and start to blame myself
 Somebody help
 You weren't perfect but you made life worth it
 Stick around, real feelings might surface
 Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom gripping you up and choking you
 What the hell was I supposed to do
 I know you aint getting this type of d-ck from that local dude
 And if you are I hope you are have a good time
 Cause I definitely be having mine
 And you aint finna see a mogul get emotional
 Every time I hear bout other n-gga's stroking you
 Might say I hit you
 He sitting there consoling you
 Threw the money, threw the mud
 Who's provoking you
 You should be grateful a n-gga like me even knows you
 Now you noticeable and can't nobody can control you
 1am and can't nobody get a hold of you
 I'm calling your brothers phone like what was I supposed to do
 Even though I knew, he never told the truth
 He was just gon say whatever you gon told him too
 At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
 Chuck dirt on eachother like mud wrestlers
 I heard he bought some coke with my money
 Dat aint right girl
 You getting blackmailed for that white girl
 You always said Yeezy I aint you're right girl
 Probably find one of them "I like art" type girls
 All of the lights, she was caught in the hype girl
 And I was satisfied being in love with the lights
 And who to blame, you to blame, me to blame
 For the pain and it poured everytime it rained
 Lets play the blame game...
 Things used to be, now they not
 Anything but us is who we are
 Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
 We've become public enemies
 We walk away like strangers in the street
 Gon for eternity
 We erased one another
 So far from where we came
 With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing
 Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
 Hatred and attitude tear us entirely
 And I know that you are somehwere doing your thing
 And when the phone called it just ring and ring
 You aint pick up but your phone accidently called me back
 And I heard the whole thing.
 I heard the whole thing, the whole thing, the whole thing...
 Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees
 Blood on the leaves
 I just need to clear my mind now
 It's been racin' since the summertime
 And I'm holdin' down the summer now
 And all I want is what I can't buy now
 Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
 And I told you to wait
 Yeah I told you to wait
 So I'mma need a little more time now
 Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
 And I thought you could wait
 Yeah, I thought you could wait
 These bitches surroundin' me
 All want somethin' out me
 Then they talk about me
 Would be lost without me
 We could've been somebody
 Thought you'd be different 'bout it
 Now I know you not it
 So let's get on with it
 We could've been somebody
 'Stead you had to tell somebody
 Let's take it back to the first party
 When you tried your first molly
 And came out of your body
 And came out of your body
 Running naked down the lobby
 And you was screamin' that you love me
 Before the limelight tore ya
 Before the limelight stole ya
 Remember we were so young
 When I would hold you
 Before the glory
 I know there ain't wrong with me
 Something strange is happening
 You could've been somethin'
 We could've ugh, we could've been somebody
 Or was it all our first party
 When we tried our first molly
 And came out of our body
 And came out of our body
 Before they call lawyers
 Before you tried to destroy us
 How you gon' lie to the lawyers?
 It's like I don't even know ya
 I gotta bring it back to the 'Nol
 Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down with my niggas
 Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down with my niggas
 Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down with my niggas
 I ride with my niggas, I'll die for my...
 To all my second string bitches, tryna get a baby
 Trying to get a baby, now you talkin' crazy
 I don't give a damn if you used to talk to Jay-Z
 He ain't with you, he with Beyonc&#233;, you need to stop actin' lazy
 She Instagram herself like #BadBitchAlert
 He Instagram his watch like #MadRichAlert
 He only wanna see that ass in reverse
 Two-thousand-dollar bag with no cash in your purse
 Now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the other side
 Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid
 Then she said she impregnated, that's the night your heart died
 Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that
 Main reason cause your pastor said you can't abort that
 Now your driver say that new Benz you can't afford that
 All that cocaine on the table you can't snort that
 That going to that owing money that the court got
 On and on that alimony, uh, yeah-yeah, she got you homie
 'Til death but do your part, unholy matrimony
 Yeezy season approaching
 Fuck whatever y'all been hearing
 Fuck what, fuck whatever y'all been wearing
 The monster about to come alive again
 Soon as I pull up and park the Benz
 We get this bitch shaking like Parkinsons
 Take my number and lock it in
 Indian hair, no moccasins
 It's too many hoes in this house of sin
 Real nigga back in the house again
 Black Timbs all on your couch again
 Black dick all in your spouse again
 And I know she like chocolate men
 She got more niggas off than Cochran (Huh)
 How much you wanna give a fuck?
 Let me show you right now before you give it up
 How much do I not give a fuck?
 Let me show you right now before you give it up
 He'll give us what we need
 It may not be what we want
 Baby girl tryna get a nut
 And her girl tryna give it up
 Chopped em both down
 Don't judge 'em Joe Brown
 One last announcement
 No sports bra, lets keep it bouncin
 Everybody tryna live at the top of the mountain
 Took her to the peak she tried to sip the fountain
 That when David Grutman kicked her out
 But I got to fucking put my dick in her mouth
 White slut bitch call me Elvis
 Another bitch she call me selfish
 Success got them jealous
 Shorty's killin', I'm ridin', I'm drillin'
 Tattoos, I'mma break the news
 It was real [?] major moves
 Last night my bitches came in twos
 And they both suck like they came to lose
 Dropped out the first day of school
 Cause niggas had cocaine to move
 I'm goin' hard, I got a name to prove
 Killin' them [?] pain improve
 We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
 This the greatest shit in the club
 Since "In the club"
 It's so packed I might ride around
 With no bodyguard back like Prince in the club
 She say "Can you get my friends in the club?"
 I say "Can you get my Benz in the club?"
 If not, treat your friends like my Benz
 Park they ass outside 'til the evening end
 When I go raw, I like to leave it in
 When I wake up, I like to go again
 When I go to work she gotta call it in
 She can't go to work, same clothes again
 And her heart colder than the souls of men
 Louboutin on her toes again
 Tight dress [?]
 Yeezus just rose again
 I can hold my liquor
 But this man can’t handle his weed
 Dark and lonely now
 On Chicago, south of town
 I'm on to Indiana
 I heard it in the radio now
 I can't handle no liquor
 But these bitches can't handle me
 I can't control my niggas
 And my niggas they can't control me
 You say you know me, my nigga
 But you really just know the old me
Bitch I'm back out my coma
Waking up on your sofa
When I park my Range Rover
Slightly scratch your Corolla
Okay, I smashed your Corolla
I'm hanging on a hangover
Five years we been over
Ask me why I came over
One more hit and I can own ya
One more fuck and I can own ya
One cold night in October
Pussy had me floating
Feel like Deepak Chopra
Pussy had me dead
Might call 2Pac over
Yeezy's all on you sofa
These the red Octobers
Still ain't learn me no manners
You love me when I ain't sober
You love me when I'm hungover
Even when I blow doja
Then her auntie came over
Skinny bitch with no shoulders
Tellin' you that I'm bogus
Bitch you don't even know us
"Baby girl, he's a loner
Baby girl, he's a loner
Late night organ donor
After that he disown ya
After that he's just hopeless
Soul mates become soulless
When he's sober it's over"
And bitch, I'm back out my coma
 heard you need a new fad
 I heard you need a new stack
 I heard you need a new phone
 I know your 'rents ain't be home
 Callin' up your uncle's place
 Shit's all over the place
 I don't hear your phone
 Ohhh I wanna phone home
 I need to call it off, I need to make it known
 'Nother one, something gone, Capricorn
 Dancing out on the lawn, fancy like the things she likes
 She lives her life, I'm living mine
 All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan
 Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, chop it and spray
 All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan
 Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, chop it and spray
 Maybe it's cause she into Leos
 And I was into trios, plus all the trips to Rio
 Couldn't have helped, it's gettin' cold
 Better bring your ski clothes, pick it through the keyhole
 The door locked by myself and I'm feelin' it right now
 Cause it's the time when my heart got shot down
 Blocka-blocka, blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka
 Pour a little champagne, cranberry vodka
 Feelin' lied to like parents never said you adopted
 Your feelings like Zulu, then nothing is a Shaka
 I hit her with Jamaican dick, I'm the new Shabba
 She lookin' for her daddy, call me Big Poppa
 On to the next saga
 Focus on the future and let the crew knock her
 Star Wars fur, yeah I'm rockin' Chewbacca

 If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?
 If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?
 Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go
 If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?
 Let me go, let me go
 My momma was raised in an era when,
 Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
 Doing clothes you would have thought I had help
 But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself.
 You see it's broke nigga racism
 That's that "Don't touch anything in the store"
 And there's rich nigga racism
 That's that "Come here, please buy more"
