I'm livin' in the 21st century
Doin' something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music
No one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power
(21st century schizoid man)
The system broken, the schools closed, the prisons open
We ain't got nothin' to lose, ma'f-cka, we rollin'
Huh? Ma'f-cka, we rollin'
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man's world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I see you in the mornin'
Huh? I see you in the mornin'
This is way too much, I need a moment
No one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power
'Til then, f-ck that, the World's ours
And then they (Go)
And then they
And then they (Go)
And then they (21st century schizoid man)
F-ck SNL and the whole cast
Tell 'em Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically, they can kiss my asshole
I'm an asshole? You n-ggas got jokes
You short-minded n-ggas' thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He know, he so, f-ckin' gifted
I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
Is honestly being prodded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catchin' up with me
Takin' my inner child, I'm fighting for it, custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my dia-mond-encrusted piece
N-gga, no one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power
'Til then, f-ck that, the World's ours
And then they (Go)
And then they
And then they (Go)
And then they
And then they (Go)
And then they (21st century schizoid man)
Colin Powells, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole f-ckin' nation
They say I was the obamanation (abomination) of Obama's nation
Well, that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of day, goddammit, I'm killin' this sh-t
I know damn well y'all feelin' this sh-t
I don't need yo' p-ssy, bitch, I'm on my own d-ck
I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?
How 'Ye doin'? I'm survivin'
I was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where ya hidin'?
I got the power, make yo' life so excitin' (So excitin')
Now this would be a beautiful death
Jumpin' out the window
Lettin' everything go
Lettin' everything go
N-now-now this would be a beautiful death
Jumpin' out the window
Lettin' everything go
Lettin' everything go
Now this would be a beautiful death
Jumpin' out the window
Lettin' everything go
Lettin' everything go
You got the power to let power go
Pop queens, how many topless, black foxes, 
Did I have under my bealt, like boxers, not to brag but if it add up, 1, 2 it's mad nuts, 
Dame you mad nuts, 
How you gon call out all these, these niggas know a damn what they gon call me, the only dream of the ghetto prom queen, 
Was to make it to the screen, baby get seen, 
Maybe get chose by a nigga from a team, 

Head so good he don't ask for a preen, 
Now ask yourself this question, 
Would you be jay z if he wasn't C.E, would you be with F A B O if he drove with NE-YO, would you drive with NE-YO if he was in G.O, 
Oh why the hell you think these niggas coming at me for, since they all fallin my poem, I take a trio
 fantasized about this back in Chicago
 Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago
 That's me, the first year that I blow
 How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo
 Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
 Me found bravery in my bravado
 DJ's need to listen to the model's
 You ain't got no f-ckin' Yeezy in your Serrato?
 (You ain't got no Yeezy, n-gga?)
 Stupid, but what the f-ck do I know?
 I'm just a Chi-town n-gga with a Nas flow
 And my bitch in that new Phoebe Philo
 So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow
 Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
 Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon-a Lewis
 Beyond the truest
 Hey, teacher, teacher
 Tell me how do you respawn the students?
 And refresh the page and restart the memory?
 Respark the soul and rebuild the energy?
 We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies
 Sorry for the night demons still visit me
 The plan was to drink until the pain over
 But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
 Fresh air, rolling down the window
 Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
 Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
 Don't make me pull the toys
 And fire up the engines
 And then they make noooise
 At the mall there was a seance
 Just kids, no parents
 Then the sky filled with heron
 (I saw the devil) In a Chrysler LeBaron
 And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
 (And the fires did declare us)
 (But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress)
 (And moved her back in Paris)
 Your my devil your my angel, 
 Your my heaven your my hell, 
 Your my now your my never, 
 Your my freedom your my jail, 
 Your my lies your my truth, 
 Your my war your my truce, 
 Your my questions your my proof, 
 Your stress and your my masseuse, 
 Mama say mama say momma Dondas' son, 
 Lost in this plastic life, 
 Lets break out of this fake ass party and turn this into a classic night, 
 If we die in each others arms, 
 We'll still get laid in the after-life, 
 If we die in each others arms we'll still get laid. 
 Chain Heavy/Sweat off My Face 

 (Chorus) my chain heavy yeah yeah my chain heavy, my chain heavy, my chain too heavy (repeat 2x) 

 They try to tell me my chain broke the levy, 
 Maybe cuz it's flooded, 
 Why you walkin' round with a baby cross his cousin, 
 My teeth already white yall gone make me floss for nothing, 
 My teeth real diamonds what's the cause of the frontin', 
 While yall got all caps on?, 
 Don Cheadle Time, 
 Get extra black on em', 
 Burn Hollywood burn, 
 Take too long for the homies to get their turn, 
 Probably be cremated before I get my urn, 
 They try to tell that aliens built the pyramids, 
 I swear life's a bitch on a period, 
 For every instant cuz every hoe thinks you see, 
 I made my jeweler add a few mo links, 

 You can look at me and tell I don't care what nobody think, 
 And my face always lookin' like somebody stink. 

 (Chorus) my chain heavy yeah yeah my chain heavy, my chain heavy, my chain too heavy (repeat 2x) 

 Here we go, like we should, 
 Feel the sweat, on ya face, 
 Here we go, like we should, 
 Feel the sweat, on ya face, 
 Alright okay, feel the sweat on ya face, h 
 Ere we go, like we should, like we should, like we should 

 What color was the skin that bared the cross, 
 No matter how many lashes they couldn't beat it off, 
 How many caskets will we see in one lifetime?, 
 That's why Miles Davis coping is mic time, 
 I keep that notebook on my ottoman, 
 And wrote hooks about slaves that was slaughtered in the 1800's, 
 Yall forget that I got called nigger on Twitter so many times, 
 Man I lived that, 
 Man I'm just trying to find out where to raise my kids at, 
 Cuz they don't want where they crib at, 
 Hey real tom lookin' for a nice park, 
 Twelve noon she say my family gone make it too dark, 
 This is the flow that solar eclipses, 
 So hopefully one day that real soul will eclipse the bullshit, they got us listenin' to,
 In this existence, 
 Don't give up now just a little mo persistence, 
 I want to thank Ice Cube and Michael Jackson 
 Keep 'em away huh, something might happen, 
 This is the making of a masterpiece, so we broke out the chains and told the master peace.
 All of the lights 
 All of the lights 
 All of the lights 
 Your my Devil, Your my Angel

 If we die in each others arms, still get laid, yeah. 

 Run from the lights, 
 Run from the night, 
 Run for your life.

 Life is a beach but look what the sand brang's
 Pullin mo' bitches than old people & ham strang's

 Spend nothing, I can't change unless I met that
 Special chick who's alway's around me
 Something like my neckalace & don't eva try
 Ta clown me that's why you on da special list
 Had my heart from the start you myy specialist
 Baby girl you gorgeous like them marblefloor's is

 Hook} - Look at the way you look
 You flyer than fly waz
 You do what I doe's
 Ya body is far away & I'm
 Tryin be ya tourist
 Would call yah sexy but you got

 To much class for that so I'm'ma
 Just say Gorgeous
 Gossip gossip
 N-ggas just stop it
 Everybody know (I'm a muthaf-cking monster)
 I'ma need to see your f-cking hands at the concert
 I'ma need to see your f-cking hands at the concert
 Profit profit, n-gga I got it
 Everybody know I'm a muthaf-cking monster
 I'ma need to see your f-cking hands at the concert
 I'ma need to see your f-cking hands at the...

 The best living or dead hands down huh?
 Less talk more head right now huh?
 And my eyes more red than the devil is
 And I'm bout to take it to another level bitch
 There you go again, aint nobody as cold as this
 Do the rap and the track tripled up and no assist
 But my only focus is staying on some bogus sh-t
 Argue with my older bitch acting like I owe her sh-t
 I heard the people sayin raps are gettin trap mayne
 Bought the chain that always give me back pain
 F-ckin up my money so yeh I had to act sane
 Chi n-gga but he's hold of his accent
 I love it though
 I love it though
 Uh put your hands to the constellations
 They way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
 I know I'm preaching to the congregation
 We love Jesus but she done learned a lot from Satan
 May the Lord forgive us
 May the God's be with us
 And that magic hour I seen good christians make rrash decisions
 Oh she do it, what happened to Religion?
 Oh she lose it
 She putting on her make up
 She casually allure
 Text message break up, the casualty of tour
 How she gone wake up and not love me no more
 I thought I was the ass hole, I guess it's rubbing off
 Hood phenomenom the Lebron of rhyme
 Hard to be humble when you stuntin on a jumbotron
 I'm looking at her like "this what you really want it, huh?"
 What we argue anyway, oh I forgot it's summertime
 When the sun go down it's the magic hour
 The magic hour
 And outta all the colours that are still up the skies
 You got green on your mind
 I can see it in your eyes
 Why you standing there with your face screwed up
 Don't leave while your hot that's how Mase screwed up
 Throwing sh-t around I hope place screwed up
 Maybe I should call Mase so that he could pray for us
 Or hit the Jamaica spot at the bar, take a seat
 I ordered your jerk she said you are what you eat
 You see I always loved your sense of humour
 But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
 The Lyor Cohen or Dior Homme that's Dior Homme not Dior homie
 The crib scarface couldn't be more Tony
 You love me for me could you be more phoney
 A little sugar, honey suckle lamb
 Great expression of happiness
 Boy, you could not miss with a dozen roses
 Such would astound you
 The joy of children laughing around you
 These are the makings of you
 It is true, the makings of you, oh
 I do it for the fore-fathers and the street authors
 That are not A&R's in the cheap office
 Rappers that never got signed but they keep offers
 Girls that's way too fine for us to keep off us
 Gave her a handshake only for my man's sake
 She in her birthday suit cause of the damn cake
 Now there's crumbs all over the damn place
 And she want me to cum all over her damn face
 I never understood planned parenthood
 Cause I never met nobody plan to be a parent in the hood
 Taking refills of that plan B pill
 Another shorty that won't make it to the family will
 If I don't make it, can't take it, hope the family will
 They aint crazy they don't know how insanity feel
 Don C just had a shorty so it's not that bad
 But I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had
 No Electro, no metro, a little retro, I perfecto
 You know the demo, ya boy act wild
 You aint get the memo, Yeezy's back in style
 Now when Rome go Gidget the other got Bridget
 What's more tripped out though is they sisters
 Nah, you aint listen, they black, they sisters
 They momma, named them after white bitches
 So next time you see me on your fallopian
 Though the Jewelry's Egytian, know the hunger's Ethiopian
 Stupid questions like "Is he gon be dope again?
 Have You seen him? has anybody spoke to him?"
 This beat deserves Hennessy, a bad bitch and a bag of weed the Holy Trinity
 In the mirror where I see my only enemy,
 Your life's cursed, well mine's an obscenity
 This is my momma sh-t
 I used to hear this through the walls in the hood when I was back in my pyjama sh-t
 Afro's and marijuana sticks, seeds and the ganja hat will be popping like the sample that I'm rhyming with
 Pete Rock, let the needle drop
 I seen so much as a kid they surprised I don't needle pop
 Taking sips of pop, six packs of millanips
 Pink champel, Valentine L
 Bally's on my feet help me balance out well
 That and the sh-t I used to balance on the scale
 I got it honest from the parties from my momma's
 Virgin Mary's try to judge her, I'm like "where the Madonna's now?"
 Give all glory to Gloria, they said "you raised that boy too fast, but you was raising a warrior"
 We victorious, they'll never take the joy from us
 I'm so appalled
 I fall, then ball
 Balled in and Donald Trump taking dollars from yall
 Baby your fire and your girlfriend is higha
 And if you don't mind, I'm gonna? On call
 We are but a law, we don't give a fuck by yall
 Like the dogs that chew a fuckin' hole through the wall
 But since they all lovers
 I need more rubbers
 And if I don't use rubbers, need more covers
 House keeping, I mean gawd damn one time
 Let it be a bad bitch sweeping
 That know we get Os like Cheerios
 That know cuz they seen us in the videos
 That know, that the day that you play me
 Will be the same day, that MTV play videos
 ... that was a little joke, Vala!
 Praises due to the most high, Allah
 Praises due to the most fly, Prada
 Baby I'm magic, Tada!
 Address me as your highness

High as United, 30, 000 feet up and you are not invited
Niggas be writin' bullshit like they gotta work
Niggas going through real shit, man they outta work
That's why I never got a gawd damn dance track, gotta hurt
That's why I rather spit something that gotta perch
Champagne wishes, 30 white bitches
I mean the shit is, fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous, I mean the shit is
Fucking ridiculous... Fucking ridiculous, I mean the shit is fucking ridiculous
My name on the highlines
Written across your skylines
Lookin' out my rolly
Motha fucka, it's my time
By the way, what a way to act with the?
We the black dystany
These the days of our lives
Hating from the sidelines
Giving you the guidelines
On a bathroom wall I wrote
"I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else" (else, else, else)
I took a piss and dismiss it and went and found somebody else
Arguing harvesting the feelings, I'd rather be by my f-cking self
Till about 2am and I call back and I hang up and start to blame myself
Somebody help
You weren't perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around, real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom gripping you up and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do
I know you aint getting this type of d-ck from that local dude
And if you are I hope you are have a good time
Cause I definitely be having mine

And you aint finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other n-gga's stroking you
Might say I hit you
He sitting there consoling you
Threw the money, threw the mud
Who's provoking you
You should be grateful a n-gga like me even knows you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody can control you
1am and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm calling your brothers phone like what was I supposed to do
Even though I knew, he never told the truth
He was just gon say whatever you gon told him too
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Chuck dirt on eachother like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
Dat aint right girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said Yeezy I aint you're right girl
Probably find one of them "I like art" type girls
All of the lights, she was caught in the hype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with the lights
And who to blame, you to blame, me to blame
For the pain and it poured everytime it rained
Lets play the blame game...
Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gon for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely
Let's play the blame game, I love you, more
Let's play the blame game for sure.
Let's call her names, names, I hate you, more.
Let's call her names, names, for sure.
nd I know that you are somehwere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
You aint pick up but your phone accidently called me back
And I heard the whole thing.
I heard the whole thing, the whole thing, the whole thing...
Now imma need you to kill the hypocrisy, this an aristocracy 
I'm Socrates but my skin more chocolaty 
"what's up wooo" that's old news 
I'm in a speed boat, in my boat shoes 
Ha? 
I swear my whole collection so cruise 
I might walk in nobu, with no shoes 
He just walked in nobu like it was wholefoods 
That nigger crazy I told you 
Immatue adult insecure asshole (What else) 
If you fall on the concrete that's your asphalt 
If you pass on that Kane beat, that's your last thought 
Get what you ask for I swear that's your ass thought 
She got a big booty but she couldnt drop that ass low 
So you take your last hoe and rope up all the cash flow 
When you getting money they be all up on your ass yo 
When you getting money cuts don't matter cus a nigger past go 
Straight to jail yo, in a hell hole 
Right next to lucifer, tell him I said hello 
Ask if imma be there soon, and tell him I said hell no. 
Poor the champagne let your watch show 
Shortie got a man watch, wrist look colossal 
I admit my first watch was a fossil 
Now I'm in the louvre looking for fossils 
Attention to detail is so uncanny 
And the whips on this? is so uncamrie 
Somebody needs to put us on camera 
The world of rollies and everyones family 
Stay jordan fresh suites and ferraris coupes 
N shortie watch barneys? we head the barneys? 
End up at 'mani giorgi and service from sergio pacini 
Lamborghini the chain blow off the vertigo 
I know the flow just hit a hella-fied vertical 
This the cris year, last year was magic 32 
Lyricaly cant' none of yall murder Ye' 
Cus yall raps aint got no vertebrae 
I got style ask julie she heard in may 
I killt the fur last, Paris rasied the murder rate 
FIrst of all we all know the beats is 
Like a mix between fergie and jeez 
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception 
Everyone of his majesty's swim partys is pageantrys 
Cannon ball of the diving board when I am bored 
All my hommies GD's but I am lord 
Rap god, Greek mythology 
And this life to crazy to think logicaly 
Heres somthing that you can use an analogy 
My life is like a childs solutions become reality 
He walked in our lives 
I was only five 
Superman pajama's I was super duper fly 
Sitting here like why, he at least supersize 
You know I scrutinise like who this newer guy 
I'm my mama boyfriend I'm her little husband 
I was the man of the house when there wasn't 
Trying to get to know homie just kill the charm 
You ain't interested in me you just tryna f-ck my mum 
We are the voices of our parents bad choices 
The aftermath of divorces 
The kids of bitter split ups 
And baby sitters 
Grand parents that don't know what to do with us 
And the last thing I want to see is mama's new n-gga 
You old Old Spice wearing 
Short chain wearing 
Dress shoes and jogging pants wearing 
Church sock wearing 
When you first stop caring about your appearance 
When you get here anyway I already got parents 
Don't try to put me inline I already got crayons 
My mama said I could do it I already got clearance 
Keep your hands of my mama how I need to got clearance 
Yeah I know she look good but you need to stop staring 
I drew a picture of her that would make her proud 
But the door was locked and the TV up so loud 
I scream out "I ain't going to sleep no time soon, 
And when I do I'm sleeping in my mama room"
I don't like you n-gga 
If I was old enough I would fight you n-gga 
I wanna run over you in my bike you n-gga 
Don't go to sleep at night you n-gga
And it seems like I wasted time 
If that's what it's all about 
Mama if that's moving up than I 
When I become my mama's boyfriends 
Twenty years later where has the time gone 
Now you see I'm dating having problems of my own 
Now that I'm grown the tables turned around 
I never thought I'd ever raise another n-ggas child 
He don't like his mama's boyfriend 
Just like me don't wanna do the wrong thing 
That's very un Spike Lee but he be like he go round his mama then 
Cause when she here he be quiet 
When she leave he be talking again 
He be wylin again 
Be calm I don't drink the drama 
A sip of Dom Tyler-Perry-on 
You gon marry my mom look 
I don't read palms and I don't read psalms 
And I did take little man to church 
And took little man to school 
Look littl eman kids don't make the rules 
Even though I aint raised you 
You your mama angel 
Don't get it twisted baby boy I'll Ving Rhames you 
Something wrong
I hold my head
MJ gone... our n-gga dead!
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I'm heading home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a n-gga replacing me
I had to take 'em to that ghetto university
Restraining order
Can't see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation
We met at Borders
Told her she take me back
I'll be more supportive
I made mistakes
I bump my head
Courts suck me dry
I spent that bread
She need a daddy
Baby please, can't let her grow up in that ghetto university
Us living as we do upside-down,
And the new words of hell is revolution,
People don't even want to hear the preachers spill or squeal,
Because God's hole card has been thoroughly peaked
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey,
The Youngsters who were programmed to continue fucking up,
Woke up one night digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys
America stripped from bed and we have not all yet closed our eyes,
The signs of truth were tattooed across our au-the-ne-tic vagina,
We learned to our amazement the untold tale of scandal,
Two long centuries burried in a rusty vault, hosed down daily with gagging perfume,
America was a bastard the illegitimate daughter of the mother country whose legs were then spread around the world and a rapist known as freedom, freedoom
Democracy, liberty and justice were revolutionary code names, that proceeded the (bubbling x4)
In the mother country's crotch,
What does Webster say about soul?
All I want is a good home and a wife and a children,
And some food to feed them every night.
After all is said and done,
Build a new route to China if they'll have you
Who will survive in America? [x4]
Hello, can I speak to a, a, yeah you know who you are

She learning a new word, it's yacht
Blew the World up as soon as I hit the club with her
Too Short called, told me "I fell in love with her"
Seen by actors, ball players and drug dealers
And some lesbians that never loved n-ggas
Twisted love story True Romance
Mary Magdalene from a pole dance
I'm a freak huh, rock star life
The second girl with us, that's our wife
Hey boys and girls, I got a new riddle

Run away as fast as you can 
Never was much of a romantic 
I could never take the intimacy 
And I know it did damage 
Plus the look in your eyes, is killing me 
I guess you knew an advantage 
Cuz you can blame me for every thing 
And I don't know how imma manage 
If one day you just up and leave 
And, I always find somethin' wrong 
Yeah I always find somethin' wrong 
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long 
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most 
So I think it's time for us to have a toast 
Let's have a toast for the douchebags, 
Let's have a toast for the assholes, 
Let's have a toast for the scumbags, 
Every one of them that I know 
Let's have a toast for the jerkoffs 
That'll never take work off 
Baby, I got a plan 
Run away fast as you can
