Your
pentagram

in

night
Dancing
and
chanting
in

sacrificial
rite
Your
feet
are
dry
with
the
ashes
from
dead
babies
Who

passed
the
test
just

all
the
rest
But
never
really
understood
the
reasons
why
They
took
it
in
the
first
place
Ah
in
the
first
place

Your
feasty
eyes
wont
make
me
fall
apart
Your
turquoise
and
silver
wont
weaken
this
old
heart
Yeah
dancing
and
chanting
in
a
sacrificial
rite
I
fell
to
the
ground
on
a
windy
windy
night
Well
I
have
passed
the
test
just
like
all
the
rest
But

snores
Right

knew

Jolene

the
singing
in
the
forest
She
opened
the
door
quietly
and
stepped
into
the
night

salty
sky
I
didnt

if
I
would
live
or

I
bombed
Korea
every
night

I
bombed
Korea
every
night
Oh
I
bombed
Korea
every
night
Red
flowers
bursting
down
below
us
Those
people
didnt
even
know
us
We
didnt
know
if
we
would
live
or
die
We
didnt
know
if
it
was
wrong
or
right
I
bombed
Korea
every
night

And
so
I
sit
here
at
this
bar
Im
not
a
hero
Im
not
a
movie
star
Ive
got
my
beer
Ive
got
my
stories
to
tell
But
they
wont
tell
you
what
its
like
in
hell
Red
flowers
bursting
down
below
us
Those
people
didnt
even
know
us
We
didnt

we
would
live

Birds
fall
from
the
window
ledge
above
mine
Then
they
flap
their
wings
at
the
last
second


You
see
birds
fall
from
the
window
ledge
above
mine
Then
they
flap
their
wings
at
the
last
second
I
can
see
their
dead
weight
Just
dropping
like
stones
For
small
loaves
of
bread
Past
my
window
all
the
time
But
unless
I
get
up
Walk
across
the
room
And
peer
down
below
I
dont
see
their
last
second
curves
Toward
a
horizontal
flight
All
these
birds
just
falling
from
the
ledge
like
stones


Now
due
to
a
construct
in
my
mind
That
makes
their
falling
and
their
flight
Symbolic
of
my
entire
existence
It
becomes
important
for
me
To
get
up
and
see
Their
last
second
curves
toward
flight
Its
almost
as
if
my
life
will
fall
Unless
I
see
their
ascent

Shes
gonna
hand
you
a
redheaded
Gabriel
Coming
from
the
bar
in
a
plastic
tie
Hes
gonna
swing
from
the
tree
of
life
Hes
gonna
try
and
sell
you
on
a
great
big
lie

But
when
you
speak
to
her
her
eyes
light
up
The
music
spills
right
into
your
cup
The
minstrels
play
and
the
waitress
brings
ice
There
are
pies
on
a
carousel
have
a
slice
But
watch
out
she
aint
no
good
for
you

Hes
gonna
spin
like
the
tractor
pull
Shell
sit
back
when
he
tells
his
tale
Hes
gonna
yell
when
he
drinks
his
beer
Shell
sit
back
and
drink
ginger
ale

But
when
you
speak
to
her
her
eyes
light
up
The
music
spills
right
into
your
cup
Its
so
abrupt
and
its
so
concise
There
are
pies
on
a
carousel
have
a
slice
But
watch
out
she
aint
no
good
for
you
I
say
Watch
out
she
aint
no
good
for
you

Shed
like
to
put
you
in
her
zoo
Right
between
the
canaries
and
the
cockatoos
Shell
pull
out
your
feathers
for
her
brand
new
hat
And
when
shes
done
that
shell
feed
you
to
her
cat
So
watch
out
she
aint
no
good
for
you
Watch
out
she
aint
no
good
for
you
Watch
out
she
aint
no

We
know
of
an
ancient
radiation
That
haunts
dismembered
constellations
A
faintly
glimmering
radio
station

While
Frank
Sinatra
sings
Stormy
Weather
The
flies
and
spiders
get
along
together
Cobwebs
fall
on
an
old
skipping
record

Beyond
the
suns
that
guard
this
roost
Beyond
your
flowers
of
flaming
truth
Beyond
your
latest
ad
campaigns

An
old
man
sits
collecting
stamps
In
a
room
all
filled
with
Chinese
lamps
He
saves
what
others
throw
away
He
says
that
hell
be
rich
someday

We
know
of
an
ancient
radiation
That
haunts
dismembered
constellations
A

radio

We

While

sings
Stormy
Weather
The
flies
and
spiders
get
along
together
Cobwebs
fall
on
an
old
skipping
record
Reluctantly
crouched
at
the
starting
line
Engines
pumping
and
thumping
in
time
The
green
light
flashes
the
flags
go
up
Churning
and
burning
they
yearn
for
the
cup

They
deftly
maneuver
and
muscle
for
rank
Fuel
burning
fast
on
an
empty
tank
Reckless
and
wild
they
pour
through
the
turns
Their
prowess
is
potent
and
secretly
stern

As
they
speed
through
the
finish
the
flags
go
down
The
fans
get
up
and
they
get
out
of
town
The
arena
is
empty
except
for
one
man
Still
driving
and
striving
as
fast
as
he
can

The
sun
has
gone
down
and
the
moon
has
come
up
And
long
ago
somebody
left
with
the
cup
But
hes
driving
and
striving
and
hugging
the
turns
And
thinking
of
someone
for
whom
he
still
burns

Hes
going
the
distance
Hes
going
for
speed
Shes
all
alone
All
alone
All
alone
in
her
time
of
need

Because
hes
racing
and
pacing
and
plotting
the
course
Hes
fighting
and
biting
and
riding
on
his
horse
Hes
going
the
distance
Ahh
ahh

Yah
Oh

No
trophy
no
flowers
no
flashbulbs
no
line
Hes
haunted
by
something
he
cannot
define
Bowelshaking
earthquakes
of
doubt
and
remorse
Assail
him
impale
him
with
monster
truck
force

In
his
mind
hes
still
driving
still
making
the
grade
Shes
hoping
in
time
that
her
memories
will
fade
Cause
hes
racing
and
pacing
and
plotting
the
course
Hes
fighting
and
biting
and
riding
on
his
horse

The
sun
has
gone
down
and
the
moon
has
come
up
And
long
ago
somebody
left
with
the
cup
But
hes
striving
and
driving
and
hugging
the
turns
And
thinking
of
someone
for
whom
he
still
burns

Cause
hes
going
the
distance
Hes
going
for
speed
Shes
all
alone
All
alone
All
alone
in
her
time
of
need

Because
hes
racing
and
pacing
and
plotting
the
course
Hes
fighting
and
biting
and
riding
on
his
horse
Hes
racing
and
pacing
and
plotting
the
course
Hes
fighting
and
biting
and
riding
on
his
horse
Hes
going
the
distance
Hes
going
for
speed
Hes
going
the
distance
Ahh
ahh

to
let
you
go
I
need
your
arms
around
me
I
need
to
feel
your
touch
I
need
your
understanding
I
need
your
love
so
much
You
tell
me
that
you
love
me
so
You
tell
me
that
you
care
But
when
I
need
you

baby
Baby

youre
never
there

On
the
phone
long
long
distance
Always
through
such
strong
resistance
First
you
say
youre
too
busy
I
wonder
if
you
even
miss
me

Never
there
Youre
never
there
Youre
never
ever
ever
ever
there

A
golden
bird
that
flies
away
A
candles
fickle
flame
To
think
I
held
you
yesterday
Your
love
was
just
a
game
A
golden
bird
that
flies
away
A
candles
fickle
flame
To
think
I
held
you
yesterday
Your
love
was
just
a
game

You
tell
me
that
you
love
me
so
You
tell
me
that
you
care
But
when
I
need
you

baby
Baby

Take
the
time
to
get
to
know
me
If
you
want
me
why
cant
you
just
show
me
Were
always
on
this
roller
coaster
If
you
want
me
why
cant
you
get
closer

Never
there
Youre
never
there
Youre
never
ever
ever
ever
there

Never

Youre

Im
sitting
by
the
Window
of
your
Thirtysecond
Floor
apartment


Waiting
For
your
Phone
calls
All
to
End


Im
sitting
watching
wind
blow
Watching
time
go
Watching
cars
go
by


Im
Waiting
for
these
Memories
to
Begin


If
I
Threw
my
guitar
Out
the
window
So
far
down


Would
I
Start
to
regret
it
Or
would
I
smile
And
watch
it
slowly
fall
fall
fall


Garbage
trucks
And
taxi
cabs
Dont
seem
like
they
can
Reach
me
here


The
clammer
Of
jackhammers
Seems
so
faint


Well
the
way
you
treat
me
Like
the
only
Slightly
brings
me
down
A
lot


I
dont
think
that
Ill
Ever
be
the
same


Yeah
If
I
Threw
my
guitar
Out
the
window
So
far
down


Would
I
Start
to
regret
it
Or
would
I
smile
And
watch
it
slowly
fall
fall
fall


Fall
fall
fall
Fall
fall
fall
Fall
fall
fall
You
turn
the
screws
You
tear
down
the
bridge
Flimsy
as
it
is
its
business
like
You
shake
my
hand
You
break
up
the
band
Flimsy
as
it
is
its
openmike
punk
rock
Red
white
and
blue
whoa

You
twist
the
knife
then
go
home
to
kiss
your
wife
A
bigger
better
slice
is
what
youd
like
You
kick
the
sand
you
get
the
upper
hand
You
sell
it
to
Japan

Its
natural
punk
rock
Red
white
and
blue
whoa

You
turn
the
screws
Its
what
you
choose
to
do
You
think
that
I

Must
turn
them
too
You
think
that
I
must
be
so
satisfied
I
stay
inside
I
wonder
why

And
the
cement
mixer
gets
it
all
ready
One
good
turn
at
a
time
Theyre
pouring
it
slowly
and
steady
Youre
showing
me
where
I
can
sign
What
I
can
expect
to
find
But
how
can
you
say
youll
be
happy

When
you
turn
the
screws

You
turn
the
screws
Its
what
you
choose
to
do
You

You

You
tear
down
the
bridge
Flimsy

rock
Red
white

You

When
you
sleep
where
do
your
fingers
go
What
do
your
fingers
know
What
do
your
fingers
show
Where
do
your
fingers
go

When
you
sleep

Do
they
tremble
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
Or
do
you
fold
them
neatly
by
your
head

Do
they
clench
like
claws
against
your
own
skin

When
youre
living
your
day
all
over
again


When
you
sleep
When
you

Where

your

When

What

When

What

When

Where

your

go
When
you
sleep

Do
they
play
guitar
in
a
Latin
bar
Are
they
strangers
or
lovers
Do
they
drive
your
car

Are
they
swimming
submissively
Sex
acts
of
life
Or
just
cutting
through
jello
with
a
very
sharp
knife

Now
Zeus
was
a
womanizer
Always
on
the
make

But
Hera
usually
punished
her
that
Zeus
was
one
to
take

When
you
sleep
where
do
your
fingers
go

Are
they
pulling
out
weeds
from
the
dusty
soil
But
then
never
rewarded
with
the
fruits
of
their
toil
Are
they
scratching
their
nails
on
the
chalkboards
of
death
Only
seeking
attention
when
everyone
in
the
room
has
left


When
you
sleep
Where
do
your
fingers
go
When
you
sleep
What
do
your

When

What

your

When

Where

When

When

Do
they
tremble
on
the

of

Or
do
you
fold

neatly
by

A

Ive

Houses

Rivers

Where

without

Where
would
I
be
without

You
want
to
be
the
only

If

You

Im

With

Some

Ive
sung
for

And
after
each
performance
People
stand
around
and
wait
Just
to
tell
me
that
they
love
my
voice
Just
to
tell
me
that
Im
great

I
am
an
opera
singer
I
will
sing
when
youre
all

I
sing
the
mountains
crumbling

I

said

We

We

We

We

To

His

He

grooming
his

He

but
youd
better
come
with
cash
Now
his
hat
is
on
backwards
He
can
show
you
his
tattoos
He
is
in
the

business
He

Now
today

tomorrow
and
tomorrow

And
yesterday

weaving
in

And
the
fluffy
white
lines
That
the
airplane
leaves
behind
Are
drifting
right
in
front
of
the
waning
of
the
moon

He

He

He

The

On

a
sultan
in
your
onion

So
this

From

streets
of
Sacramento
to
the
freeways
of
L
A
Weve
gotta
keep
this
fire
burning
and
accept
a

So
this

is
trying
to
break
free
And
this
long

You
would

You

kill
all
the

You
would
bury
them
deep
in
the
earth

Without
the
tight

Your
virtues

Without

In
a
wooden
boat
in
the
shipping
lanes

With
the
freighters
towering
over
me

I
can
hear
the
jets
flying
overhead

Making
lines
across
the
darkening
sky

And
when
the
sun
is
going
down
I
can
take
a
taxi
into
town

And
the
waiter
at
the
restaurant
sets
a
table
just
for
me

So
I
had
a
plane
to
take
me
to
a
place
so
far
away
from
you

Eventually
we
began
to
see
that
we
could
be
completely
free

And
I
could
get
away
from
you

And
you
could
get
away
from
me

And
we
could
live
each
separately
in
our
cities
in
the
sun


Wheels

The

Ive

and

Ive
still
stayed
frozen

So
deep
in

night

My

contemplations
will
always
be
broken

My

will
stay
buried
and
unspoken

You
keep
pushing
me
away

In
spite
of
what
you
say

I
found
out
yesterday

That
Ive
been
wasting
all
my
time

Trying
to
make
you
smile

Trying
to
make
this
seem
worth
While
youve
been
pushing
me
around

In
spite
of
what
I
do

Trying
to
make
things
good
for

You
take
your
economy
car
and
your
suitcase

Take
your
psycho
little
dogs

Take
it
all
away

Youve
been
racing
through
my
mind

Youre
picking
up
in
speed

Youre
driving
recklessly

Its
like
a
car
crash
happening
on
my
street

Broken
bodies
at
my
feet

And
sirens
on
the
way

Theyre
too
late

Cause
nobodys
going
to
save
us

Were
a
rubberneckers
dream

Were
burning
gasoline

Go
take
your
economy
car
and
your
suitcase

Take
your
psycho
little
dogs

Take
it
all
away

And
go

Go
ahead
and
destroy
this

Better
come
with
an
army

Are
you
feeling
feeling
okay
baby

Nananananana

Take
your
economy
car
and
your

Take
your

Take

In
the
brown
shag
carpet
of
a
cheap
motel

In
the
dark
and
dusty
corner
by
the
TV
shelf

Is
a
small
reminder
of
a
simpler
time

When
a
crumpled
up
pair
of
trousers
lost
a
brand
new
dime

Well
you
ask
me
how
I
made
it
through
and
how
my
mint
condition
could
belong
to
you

When
Im
on
the
ground
I
roll
through
town

Im
a
president
you
dont
remember
getting
kicked
around

Im
a
dime

Im
fine

And
I
shine
Im
freshly
minted

I
am
determined
not
to
be
dented

By
a
car
or
by
a
plane
or
anything
not
yet
invented

Im
a
dime

Im
fine

And
I
shine

In
the
hiss
and
rumble
of
the
freeway
sounds

As
the
afternoon
commuters
drive
their
cars
around

Theres
a
ringle
jingle
near
the
underpass

Theres
a
sparkle
near
the
fast
food
garbage
and
roadside
trash

Im
a
dime
Im
fine

And
I
shine
Im
freshly
minted

Im
silverplated
Im
underrated

You
wont
even
pick
me
up
because
Im
not
enough
for
a
local
phone
call

Im
a
dime

Im
fine

And
I
shine

Im
a
dime
Im
fine

And
I
shine

Im
a
dime
Im
fine

And
I

Too

After

After
this
my
lungs
will
be
so

up

I
wish
I
was
in
that
Mercedes
Benz

Sealed
away
from
my
scents

Id
have
the
music
high
going

I
wish

Breathing
all
this
in

I
look
up
at
that
grey
sky

It
makes
me
want
to
ohhhh

Too

Too

Who
draws
the
crowd
who
plays
so
loud
baby
its
the
guitar
man

Whos
gonna
steal
the
show
you
know
baby
its
the
guitar
man

He
can
make
you
love
he
can
make
you
cry

He
will
bring
you
down
he
will
get
you
high

And
something
keeps
him
going
miles
and
miles
away

To
find
another
place
to
play


Night
after
night
who
treats
you
right
baby
its
the
guitar
man

Whos
on
the
radio
you
know
baby
its
the
guitar
man

When
he
comes
to
town
and
you
see
his
face

And
you
think
you
might
like
to
take
his
place

Something
keeps
him
drifting
miles
and
miles
away

Searching
for
the
songs
to
play

Then
you
listen
to
the
music
and
youd
like
to
sing
along

And
you
want
to
get
the
meaning
out
of
each
and
every
song

And
you
find
yourself
a
message
and
some
words
to
call
your
own
and
take
em
home


He
can
make
you
love
he
can
get
you
high

He
will
bring
you
down
then
hell
make
make
you
cry

Something
keeps
him
moving
but
no
one
seems
to
know

What
it
is
that
makes
him
go


Then
the
lights
begin
to
flicker
and
the
sound
is
getting
dim

The
voice
begins
to
falter
and
the
crowds
are
getting
thin

But
he
never
seems
to
notice
hes
just
got
to
find
another
place
to
play

Fade
away
Ah
ah
Got
to
play
Ah
ah
Fade
away
Ah
ah
Got
to
play
Ah
ah
Ah
ah
Ah
ah
Ah
ah
Ah
ah
So
we
think
that
were
important

And
we
think
that
we
make
sense

And
we
think
theres
something
better
on
the
other
side
of
this
fence

And
you
can
soak
your
bread
in
gravy

You
can
soak
your
bread
in
soup

But
the
car
that
you
are
driving
doesnt
really
belong
to
you

So
you
know
youll
always
be
waiting

Always
be
waiting
for
someone
else
to
call

Yeah
you
know
youll
always
be
waiting

Always
be
waiting

I
say
always
be
waiting

And
you
can
soak
your
bread
in
water

You
can
soak
your
bread
in
wine

It
can
seem
like
you
are
living
like
youre
having
a
real
good
time

And
you
can
do
it
to
your
conscience

You
can
do
it
all
the
time

You
can

long

Someday
I
know
youre
gonna
find
Just
one
mistake
is
not
enough
to
change
my
mind

Whats
now
is
now
And
Ill
forget
what

then
I
know
it
all
And
we
can
still
begin
again

And
if
the
doubting
faces
made
you

mine
that

them
all
youre
not

Launching
loony
thoughts
into
the
bending
of
your
mind
You
reach
for
something
high
but
its
a
mountain
that
you
find
Hes
a
king
dust
demon
with
an
icepick
smile
His
music
fills
your
feathers
as
you
feel
your
passions
fly

With
the
mustache
man
on
the
carpet
of
his
van
You
can
feel
your
fatty
tissues
giving
way
to
sweaty
hands
And
the
woofers
keep
distorting
and
the
tweeters
kiss
the
girls
His
hornrimmed
glasses
look
so
square
beneath
his
curls

I
have
wasted
so
much
time
I
have
wasted
so
much
time

He
is
like
a
politician
who
is
practicing
a
speech
He
is
racing
he
is
pacing
he
is
sleeping
on
his
beach
As
the
sky
begins
to
darken
and
the
waves
begin
to
roll
You
can
feel
the
oceans
rising
as
youre
losing
all
control

And
meanwhile
back
at
the
Candlerock
Lounge
It
is
past

and
your
friends
are
getting
down
Theyre
applying
purple
eyeshadow
drinking
warm
beer
Theyre
wondering
where
you
went
to
when
you
told
them
youd
be
here

I
have
wasted
so
much
time
I

In

Poisoning

Making

be
Oh

whose

are
bent
and

cause
I
just
heard
the
slamming
of
the
door
The
way
I
know
Ive
heard
it
slam
one
hundred
times
before

And
if
I
could
move
Id
get
my
gun
and
put
her
in
the
ground
Oh
Ruby
dont
take
your
love
to

I

But
if
I
told

Id

to
say

Excuse

I

Theres
an
aching
deep
inside
And

wont
be
denied
Excuse

I

Ive

And
Id

I

pride
that
makes
me
hide
my
sorrow
I
live
a
lie
in
all
I
do
and
say
My
lips
may
lie
and
paint
a
bright
tomorrow
But

they

Excuse

Strangers

Exchanging

Wondring

What

the

Wed

Before

Something

Something

Something

Told

I
must
have

Strangers
in
the

Two
lonely
people

We
were
strangers
in
the
night
Up
to
the
moment
when
we
said
our
first
hello
Little
did
we
know
Love
was
just
a
glance
away
A
warm
embracing
dance
away
and
Ever
since
that
night
Weve
been
together
Lovers
at
first
sight
In
love
forever
It
turned
out
so
right
For
strangers
in
the
night

Love

La
da
da
da

Once
I
thought
two
happy
hearts
could
someday
beat
as
one
But
then
a
third
heart
came
along
and
now
our
love
is
gone
I
count
the
many
times
Ive
said
I
love
no
one
but
you
But
dont
be
fooled
by
counting
dreams
that
never
will
come
true
Subtract
one
love
and
multiply
the
heartaches
Divide
the
tears
by
everytime
a
heart
breaks
The
answer
only
tells
us
that
its
too
late
Subtract
one
love
and
multiply
the
heartaches

Subtract

and

Divide

that
its

late
Subtract

multiply
the

Subtract

love
and
multiply
the
heartaches

Youve

and
curled
your
tinted
hair
Ruby

you
contemplating
going
out
somewhere

The
shadow
on
the
wall
tells
me
the
sun
is
going
down
Oh
Ruby
dont
take
your
love
to
town

It
wasnt
me
that
started
that
ol
crazy
Asian
war
But
I
was
proud
to
go
and
do
my
patriotic
chore

And

its
true
that
Im
not
the
man
I
used
to
be
Oh
Ruby
I
still
need
some
company

Its
hard
to
love
a
man
whose
legs
are
bent
and
paralyzed
And
the
wants
and
the
needs
of
a
woman
your
age
Ruby
I

But

Ive
heard

Oh

cause
I

the
slamming
of

door
The

one
hundred
times
before

And
if
I
could

my
gun
and

in
the
ground
Oh
Ruby

take
your
love
to

La

In

wooden
boat
in
the
shipping
lanes

With
the
freighters
towering
over
me

I
can
hear
the
jets
flying
overhead

Making
lines
across
the
darkening
sky

And
when
the
sun
is
going
down
I
can
take
a
taxi
into
town

And
the
waiter
at
the
restaurant
sets
a
table
just
for
me


Wheels

So
I
had
a
plane
to
take
me
to
a
place
so
far
away
from
you

Eventually
we
began
to
see
that
we
could
be
completely
free

And
I
could
get
away
from
you

And
you
could
get
away
from
me

And
we
could
live
each
separately
in
our
cities
in
the
sun


Wheels

The

Ive

So
deep
in
the
night

My
smooth
contemplations
will
always
be
broken

My

will
stay
buried
and
unspoken

No

I
think
Ive
got
a
heartache
And
Id
better
say
goodbye
before
I
cry

I
guess
its
pride
that
makes
me
hide
my
sorrow
I
live
a
lie
in
all
I
do
and
say
My
lips
may
lie
and
paint
a
bright
tomorrow
But
if
they
told
the
truth
theyd
have
to
say

Excuse
me
I
think
Ive
got
a
heartache
Theres
an
aching
deep
inside
And
it
just
wont
be
denied
Excuse
me
I
think
Ive
got
a
heartache
And
Id
better
say
goodbye
before
I
cry
Youve
painted
up
your
lips
and
rolled
and
curled
your
tinted
hair
Ruby

you
contemplating
going
out
somewhere

The
shadow
on
the
wall
tells
me
the
sun
is
going
down
Oh
Ruby
dont
take
your
love
to
town

It
wasnt
me
that
started
that
ol
crazy
Asian
war
But
I
was
proud
to
go
and
do
my
patriotic
chore

And
yes
its
true
that
Im
not
the
man
I
used
to
be
Oh
Ruby
I
still
need
some
company

Its
hard
to
love
a
man
whose
legs
are
bent
and
paralyzed
And
the
wants
and
the
needs
of
a
woman
your
age
Ruby
I
realize

But
it
wont
be
long
Ive
heard
them
say
until
Im
not
around
Oh
Ruby

take
your
love
to
town

Shes

cause
I
just
heard
the
slamming
of
the
door
The

it
slam
one
hundred
times
before

And
if
I
could
move
Id

my
gun
and

her
in
the
ground

Aw

all

Aw
Yeah
All

Reluctantly
crouched
at
the
starting
line
Engines
pumping
and
thumping
in
time
The
green
light
flashes
the
flags
go
up
Churning
and
burning
they
yearn
for
the
cup

They
deftly
maneuver
and
muscle
for
rank
Fuel
burning
fast
on
an
empty
tank
Reckless
and
wild
they
pour
through
the
turns
Their
prowess
is
potent
and
secretly
stern

As
they
speed
through
the
finish
the
flags
go
down
The
fans
get
up
and
they
get
out
of
town
The
arena
is
empty
except
for
one
man
Still
driving
and
striving
as
fast
as
he
can

The
sun
has
gone
down
and
the
moon
has
come
up
And
long
ago
somebody
left
with
the
cup
But
hes
driving
and
striving
and
hugging
the
turns
And
thinking
of
someone
for
whom
he
still
burns

Hes
going
the
distance
Hes
going
for
speed
Shes
all
alone
All
alone
All
alone
in
her
time
of
need

Because
hes
racing
and
pacing
and
plotting
the
course
Hes
fighting
and
biting
and
riding
on
his
horse
Hes
going
the
distance
Ahh
ahh

Yah
Oh

No
trophy
no
flowers
no
flashbulbs
no
line
Hes
haunted
by
something
he
cannot
define
Bowelshaking
earthquakes
of
doubt
and
remorse
Assail
him
impale
him
with
monster
truck
force

In
his
mind
hes
still
driving
still
making
the
grade
Shes
hoping
in
time
that
her
memories
will
fade
Cause
hes
racing
and
pacing
and
plotting
the
course
Hes
fighting
and
biting
and
riding
on
his
horse

The
sun
has
gone
down
and
the
moon
has
come
up
And
long

somebody
left
with
the

But
hes
striving

And

Shes

All

All

in

Hes

Hes

Hes

Ahh
ahh
hey

Hey
Once
I
thought
two
happy
hearts
could
someday
beat
as
one
But
then
a
third
heart
came
along
and
now
our
love
is
gone
I
count
the
many
times
Ive
said
I
love
no
one
but
you
But
dont
be
fooled
by
counting
dreams
that
never
will
come
true
Subtract
one
love
and
multiply
the
heartaches
Divide
the
tears
by
everytime
a
heart
breaks
The
answer
only
tells
us
that
its
too
late
Subtract
one
love
and
multiply
the
heartaches

Subtract
one
love
and
multiply
the
heartaches
Divide
the

every

a

The

that
its

late
Subtract
one
love

heartaches

Subtract

and
multiply

You

bring
me
down

If

you
You
wouldnt
stay
away
half
as
much
as
you
do
I

that
I
would
never
be
this
blue
If
you
only
loved
me
half

If
you
only
loved
me
half
as
much
If
you
only
loved
me
half

as
I
love
you

So
deep
in

My

will
always
be
broken

My

will
stay
buried

unspoken

No

Youve

up
your

and
rolled
and
curled
your
tinted
hair
Ruby
are
you
contemplating
going
out
somewhere

The
shadow
on
the
wall
tells
me
the
sun
is
going
down
Oh
Ruby
dont
take
your
love
to
town

It
wasnt
me
that
started
that
ol
crazy
Asian
war
But
I
was
proud
to
go
and
do
my
patriotic
chore

And
yes
its
true
that
Im
not
the
man
I
used
to
be
Oh
Ruby
I
still
need
some
company

Its
hard
to
love
a
man
whose
legs
are
bent
and
paralyzed
And
the
wants
and
the
needs
of
a
woman
your
age
Ruby
I
realize

But

Ive
heard
them
say
until

around
Oh
Ruby

take
your
love
to
town

Shes
leaving
now
cause
I
just
heard
the
slamming
of
the
door
The
way
I
know
Ive
heard
it
slam
one
hundred
times
before

And
if
I
could
move
Id
get
my
gun
and
put
her
in
the
ground
Oh
Ruby
dont
take
your
love
to
town

Oh
Ruby
God

Too
much
carbon
monoxide

After

I
wish
I

that
Mercedes
Benz

Sealed
away
from
my
scents

Id

high
going


Too

When
you
sleep
where
do
your
fingers
go
What
do
your
fingers
know
What
do
your
fingers
show
Where
do
your
fingers
go

When
you
sleep

Do
they
tremble
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
Or
do
you
fold
them
neatly
by
your
head

Do
they
clench
like
claws
against
your
own
skin

When
youre
living
your
day
all
over
again


When
you
sleep
When
you
sleep
Where
do
your
fingers
go
When
you
sleep
What
do
your
fingers
know
When
you
sleep
What
do
your
fingers
show
When
you
sleep
Where
do
your
fingers
go
When
you
sleep

Do
they
play
guitar
in
a
Latin
bar
Are
they
strangers
or
lovers
Do
they
drive
your
car

Are
they
swimming
submissively
Sex
acts
of
life
Or
just
cutting
through
jello
with
a
very
sharp
knife

Now
Zeus
was
a
womanizer
Always
on
the
make

But
Hera
usually
punished
her
that
Zeus
was
one
to
take

When
you
sleep
where
do
your
fingers
go

Are
they
pulling
out
weeds
from
the
dusty
soil
But
then
never
rewarded
with
the
fruits
of
their
toil
Are
they
scratching
their
nails
on
the
chalkboards
of
death
Only
seeking
attention
when
everyone
in
the
room
has
left


When
you
sleep
Where
do
your
fingers
go
When
you
sleep
What
do
your
fingers
know
When
you
sleep
What
do
your
fingers
show
When
you
sleep
Where
do
your
fingers
go
When
you
sleep

When
you
sleep

Do
they
tremble
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
Or
do
you
fold
them
neatly
by
your
head
Strangers
in
the
night
Exchanging
glances
Wondring
in
the
night
What
were
the
chances
Wed
be
sharing
love
Before
the
night
was
through

Something
in
your
eyes
Was
so
inviting
Something
in
your
smile
Was
so
exciting
Something
in
my
heart
Told
me
I
must
have
you
Strangers
in
the
night
Two
lonely
people

We
were
strangers
in
the
night
Up
to
the
moment
when
we
said
our
first
hello
Little
did
we
know
Love
was
just
a
glance
away
A
warm
embracing
dance
away
and
Ever
since
that
night
Weve
been
together
Lovers
at
first
sight
In
love
forever
It
turned
out
so
right
For
strangers
in
the
night

Love
was
just
a
glance
away
A
warm
embracing
dance
away
and
Ever
since
that
night
Weve
been
together
Lovers
at
first
sight
In
love
forever
It
turned
out
so
right
For
strangers
in
the
night
La
da
da
da
da
Reluctantly
crouched
at
the
starting
line
Engines
pumping
and
thumping
in
time
The
green
light
flashes
the
flags
go
up
Churning
and
burning
they
yearn
for
the
cup

They
deftly
maneuver
and
muscle
for
rank
Fuel
burning
fast
on
an
empty
tank
Reckless
and
wild
they
pour
through
the
turns
Their
prowess
is
potent
and
secretly
stern

As
they
speed
through
the
finish
the
flags
go
down
The
fans
get
up
and
they
get
out
of
town
The
arena
is
empty
except
for
one
man
Still
driving
and
striving
as
fast
as
he
can

The
sun
has
gone
down
and
the
moon
has
come
up
And
long
ago
somebody
left
with
the
cup
But
hes
driving
and
striving
and
hugging
the
turns
And
thinking
of
someone
for
whom
he
still
burns

Hes
going
the
distance
Hes
going
for
speed
Shes
all
alone
All
alone
All
alone
in
her
time
of
need

Because
hes
racing
and
pacing
and
plotting
the
course
Hes
fighting
and
biting
and
riding
on
his
horse
Hes
going
the
distance
Ahh
ahh

Yah
Oh

No
trophy
no
flowers
no
flashbulbs
no
line
Hes
haunted
by
something
he
cannot
define
Bowelshaking
earthquakes
of
doubt
and
remorse
Assail
him
impale
him
with
monster
truck
force

In
his
mind
hes
still
driving
still
making
the
grade
Shes
hoping
in
time
that
her
memories
will
fade
Cause
hes
racing
and
pacing
and
plotting
the
course
Hes
fighting
and
biting
and
riding
on
his
horse

The
sun
has
gone
down
and
the
moon
has
come
up
And
long
ago
somebody
left
with
the
cup
But
hes
striving
and
driving
and
hugging
the
turns
And
thinking
of
someone
for
whom
he
still
burns

Cause
hes
going
the
distance
Hes
going
for
speed
Shes
all
alone
All
alone
All
alone
in
her
time
of
need

Because
hes
racing
and
pacing
and
plotting
the
course
Hes
fighting
and
biting
and
riding
on
his
horse
Hes
racing
and
pacing
and
plotting
the
course
Hes
fighting
and
biting
and
riding
on
his
horse
Hes
going
the
distance
Hes
going
for
speed
Hes
going
the
distance
Ahh
ahh
hey

Hey
At
first
I
was
afraid
I
was
petrified
I
kept
thinking
I
could
never
live
Without
you
by
my
side
But
then
I
spent
so
many
nights
Just
thinking
how
youve
done
me
wrong
I
grew
strong
I
learned
how
to
get
along

And
so
youre
back
From
outer
space
I
just
walked
in
to
find
you
Here
without
that
look
upon
your
face
I
should
have
changed
my
door
lock
I
would
have
made
you
leave
your
key
If
I
had
known
for
just
one
second
Youd
be
back
to
bother
me

Oh
now

Walk
out
the
door
Just
turn
around
now
Youre
not
welcome
anymore
Werent
you
the
one
Who
tried
to
break
me
with
desire
Did
you
think
Id
crumble
Did
you
think
Id

down
and
die

Oh

love

Yeah

It
took
all
the
strength
I
had
Just
not
to
fall
apart
Im
trying
hard
to
mend
the
pieces
Of
my
broken
heart
And
I
spent
oh
so
many
nights
Just
feeling
sorry
for
myself
I
used
to
cry
But
now
I
hold
my
head
up
high

And
you
see
me
With
somebody
new
Im
not
that
stupid
little
person
Still
in
love
with
you
And
so
you
thought
youd
just
drop
by
And
you
expect
me
to
be
free
But
now
Im
saving
all
my
lovin
For
someone
whos
lovin
me

Oh

Walk

the
door
Just

welcome
