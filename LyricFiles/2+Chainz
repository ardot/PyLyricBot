Hit you with a choppa make a nigga start flipping

I go hard in the mother fucking kitchen

Hit him with the soda make a nigga start whipping
Hit you with a choppa make a nigga start flipping

I go hard in the mother fucker kitchen using baby bottles for the lean

Hot on the stove smoking like reefer
This work aint bout shit thats why its cheaper

All we blow is strong thats why you weaker
Wait up yo status change when you wait up
Waiting on the meal I already put my plate up
Nigga fall back up already put my rake up

Hair weave killa messing up her makeup
Pyrex vision and Im about to cook a cake up

Pocket full of brick money neck full of black gold
Black diamonds got the Jesus piece like []

Verse   Chainz
Broken home tell me what the fuck is wrong
Now I gotta charge a brick for a song
Trap guy turned into a rap guy
No suit on but I still got trap ties
Argyles pastels and some neckties
Shawty on the pill Xfile

And you know Im a sucker for long hair and wet thighs
Mama see the baby this is karmasutra
I got a present for you boo you looking at the future
As far as the past nevermind that
I dont know whos finer you or this wine glass
And you must rewind that if you dont get it
Got a taste of the good life and tracks is what Im eatin

Icy watch I dont mind spending time alone

Hook

Verse  Jadakiss
Yo get the clip out of the ashtray put it in the air
Grab my cellphone call my engineer
Yea last night I was on one
Quick carwash then I make a mall run

Louie store spending chips on some kicks
I already got different color
 cally chrome on deck
All the Kush gone gotta collect
On this mean five team parlay that a bush gone

Always hustle to get it
I never ask for shit
If its family or money I might have to flip
Im a say it if its on my mind
I like to take it one day at a time

Hook

Verse   Chainz
Never on the guest list

Looking at these emcees like they should make a deathwish
Got my girl in the kitchen cooking ambidextrious

This is a lifestyle I didnt have to right this
Look at my hue blow watch how the light hit
Look at my new ho watch how the light hit
I done did the dollars up die nigga
Too dehydrated to cry nigga

I wish this Aquafina bottle had wine in it
I wish that pussy had a sign in it
That said want it if you hit it then you mine nigga
Damn that crazy bitch on that crazy shit
If you dont make money it dont make sense

On medication I can drink  a day
When you hot in the A you get a spot in the A
Its so big that shit look like a spot in the A
These niggas jogging in place and they standing in line
Till somebody rhyme bout beating me then they start dancing in line
And if swag was a crime Id be doing life plus

Try to cook a brick off a George Foreman
Take a girl itll start spoiling
Living room floor look like a nigga going bowling

Im in your city todayMy ghetto dreams always turn to ghetto nightmares

At night I cant sleep I toss and turn
Candlesticks in the dark
I was whippin it hard
I was gettin the broads that like Who the hell is that
I was dealing sap
You looking at a nigga that drove to hell and back
Charismatic I was raised by an addict with money in the attic
Got goons while you at it at this Present time Im out of my mind and thats a habit
Still got them waiting in line they gotta have

Last night was the first night I got sleep
Tossing and turning for two or three weeks
My nightmares are triggered by bad memories
Lord send me an angel right now while Im having ghetto dreams

Cold sweats listenin to the old sweat
One two thats a hoe check
Now for real nigga this a whole check
Just bossin around polo sweats
Used to dream about a bigger couch
Woke up in a bigger house cmon
Commas in my bank account
So much money I had to let the banker count

Last night was the first night I got sleep
Tossing and turning for two or three weeks
My nightmares are triggered by bad memories
Lord send me an angel right now while Im having ghetto dreams

Its like the world stand still
Yesterday your little man got killed
And all he ever wanted was a bank roll
But he died too young kuz the game cold
Most niggas aint know or they just think slow
Once you get in you gotta leave but you cant though
Does freedom make a motherfucker evil
To the point down your ass when he see you
Lets take that needle fill it with poison
Inject the ghetto with the drug paranoia
Got you lookin at your homeboy sideways
Aint no honor among thieves
They tell me crime pays but I dont think so
Because every criminal I know is in the clink yo
A nigga in the game right now
Must be working for them people cause that shit played out

Daddy deserted so he now serves sandwich serving
Dreaming we had a furnace so cold sleeping on the curtains
What can I say it got me highly motivated mama two job working
But now the companies emerging
Need a two week notice before they say dont need your service
Im to young to have burdens but still feel I should be further
But who Im I kidding I had bridges but I just burned them
My mama need earnings aint had no time I had learning
Call me a hypocrite backslider you name it I done heard it
The way they speak of me you think Im already murdered
Its hard to be laid back my haters so assertive but
I gave my life up I gave my rights up
I gave my dice up and I gave my dykes up
I gave my vice up and every club that lights up
And this is were the intern with no perm lights up

You dont see my pain
I guess its beautiful pain
It gotta be beautiful pain
Sometime you dont gotta say much

Oh I feel so fly
Came so far but I still wanna fly
So come on in this car this yacht this plane
See what this beautiful pain provide

Every move leads to something better

I only do what I do so we can live
I only do what I do so we can live

Mama dont work heater dont work
Police pulled me over and said he seen weed on my shirt
I pray to the lord and ask for forgiveness
If he popped my trunk I can get a life sentence
He came a little closer and told me that he smellin it
I said I rolled one up I wont insult your intelligence
But I threw it out the window half a mile ago
He asked me when the last time I smoke I said a while ago
Forgive me officer Im stressin and my pockets sore
Hurtin chillin with my dog like a fuckin Labrador
He said he aint with the bull matador
Looked at the top of my car like what this lighter for
I told him I was puttin girls up in the mornin
And Im goin to my uncles house to see if he can join me
The officer got a call so he was needed
And he told me slow it down and I told him please believe it
Then I proceeded to go to my uncles house
Well it really wasnt my uncle it was a junkies house
He got a badass niece with a donkey now
Pullin out the parking lot headed to the other spot
Out all night addict with addicts causin Havoc Im a Prodigy
Niggas know we Mobbin Deep gotta stay up when everyone fall asleep
The good die young and promises are hard to keep
I left my old job and now them niggas hardly speak

Sippin and my soda pink you niggas is toilet seat

Conduct disorderly stayin in the trap house
Trips went to work Im so glad that it mapped out

Honey we got off on the wrong foot baby
Cause the relationship has been so good lately
If I dont do what I do then whos gon put food on the table
It is what it is Im just handling biz
But I do what I do so we can live
I only do what I do so we can live
I only do what I do so we can live

I only do what I do so we can live

Simon says monkey see monkey do
I wore the shirt you wore the same shirt too
See me with my bitch you buy your bitch the same purse
Shoot you and your nigga yall can share the same hearse
This that murder  mixed with the bubblegum
Kept working my dun dun duns come get your mama some
Nigga this that slum talk some say we talks slums
I rarely finish the end of my words
Watch the rims hit on the curve
And what a nigga really care about a lisp
People arguin over me while Im layin in a bitch
Death to a snitch get it while you can break and shit
Its  in the AM
Were just gettin started like when I had the van
Bought the tour bus and put some niggas in the pass
Your style good enough to put in a glass bag
You know Im getting mine you should use a hashtag
Flow off the hinges tryna fuck all her friendses
Just killed her pussy you gon have to use forensics
Organized crime you can put me in a lineup
Plus I got dreads Ill pay a hundred for the line up

Appetite for destruction and I dont a menu
So far ahead of yall niggas I can see you in my rearview
See you in my rearview one of your headlights out nigga
I just got my first RB bitch and got head all night with her
She said she tired of the generic
I say what up she say what up what up you a parrot
Im like Bird ass girl arent you sick of the rhetoric
And if I aint arrogant Im out of my elementLast night I bought the supermodel
Got head on the way home
She left her other friends at the club
Got home and I fucked her with my chains on
And thats ratchet huh
Her ass so big it look like she trying to walk backwards bruh
Woah bring it back

Take your bitch like Im the dog catcher
Take your ass to the mall after
Spa day shawty
Kill that pussy pallbearer
You from that RuPaul era
Im from that hell nah era
Real niggas say true
Real niggas aint you
I ride around with that yapper on me
Gun clad with my Glock up on me
Surround your ass with so many shots
Youll be claustrophobic
Crib so big a dinosaur can run through that shit
Im a shark and you a tuna fish
My paper up got your girl with her ankles up
Gangster boy

She got her Tshirt and her panties on
She trying to smell my cologne
I can fuck her anywhere I want
I even fuck her on the floor
And thats ratchet huh
Her ass so big it look like she trying to walk backwards bruh
Woah bring it back

Im on top like a toupe
You on the side like a toothache
Box your ass suitcase
Im real you aint
Calamari crab cakes
My closet the size of your damn place
You lookin at a star
I wish that they could add space
Im getting money fast pace
My hoes gave my cash straight
He cant ball castrate
She the opposite of last place
Do it bust it open slow it down Robitussin
My girl got a big ass
Your girl got back pockets touching

I want a dollar I want everything
Balls out I let her hang
Went shopping for a wedding ring
Went on a double date with Molly and Mary Jane
And thats ratchet huh
Her ass so big it look like she trying to walk backwards bruh

If you patch a weed thats ratchet
My last album was classic
Shawty on my dica
Backwards spells acid
She pop a P like a zany
Shell use no hands and no panties
She rock like nose candy
You fuck with me aint no plan B
Im a D boy with a degree
I sold dope in my mommas home
My girl pussy deep deep
So right there is my comfort zone
Born alone die alone
Mud in my styrofoam
She got on top of me like a stage
I said use my dick as a microphoneAnd when you spiral through the atmosphere
All they see is motion
They never see the tears they never feel the pain
They always think its nothing but its something such a shame
So caught up in the fantasy humanity has made a love story out of tragedy
But there is no romance in life thats on the ledge
And theres no one to talk you down and tuck you in the bed
Lord its so ironic that its funny
Of something for the books or the bars
To bob your head and nod
I recall so many never ever thought youd make it
So sad they were mistaken the joy they tried to take it
Mama said that The best thing you can do and be is you
This world aint got but one so give credit where it is due
Aint that the truth
And here you are a black unicorn
Mythical mystical since the day that you were born
Mastered all the madness let the magic have his way
Let the power paint the day let the god have his say
Cause theres a place that you can go no one else is allowed
Sitting up on your cloud so high when you look down
Just glance upon the beauty and the wonder to be found
Then know that you can stop your search cause love is all around

Yeah
Free at last free at last
Thats what I said when I got out my last deal
Some people cant relate sleep is the cousin of death that is some Nas shit
And when its cold outside so your pipes wont bust turn on your faucets
Drip fuck the water bill we stay in apartments
And everything is a obstacle
When they watching you the hospital needs a hospital
Now they mocking you they say the flattery is sincere
I rhyme like a nigga younger than me by ten years
Yeah and thats my car talking
Old school running with the dogs barking
Parked out that bitch like Im sellin coffins
Weed so strong I be seldom coughin
And Im covered in Balmain
Instagram pics of my lobster omelette
Sellin that parcake life aint no arcade
Now I got more knives than the th grade

Its all I really want
Its all I really want to be
Its all I really need
I want I want to believe
Thought you had the best of me
Now Im what you need you need

Hear ye hear ye
You cant come near me
Competition must fear me
Lyrically I could be Talib Kweli
But with gold teeth itd be hard for some to believe
I leave them pussys stinkin like Summers eve
I practicin repitition now I need a hundred Gs
A hundred Ms hug and squeeze
Dad kept us in the Dungarees rather rap but I love the cheese
I change hoes like I change gears
And my yard so big I got pet deers
And my homies try to act like aint real
I put my apron on and taught myself how to make meals
You need a focus group my group focus
Hit the loker jokers with the hocus pocus
Im the dopest you can quote this under scope
Its just me and GOAT
Dirty ass niggas will sell your ass a key of soap
Ida seen em rich Ida seen em broke
Ida seen it all watch the pregnant lady smoke
When the baby come out it gon be geeked
You never know he might come out to be me

Its all I really want
Its all I really want to be
Its all I really need
I want I want to believe
Thought you had the best of me
Now Im what you need you needIm blessed some might say Im lucky
Im blessed some might say Im lucky
Every cents huffy pockets on husky
Shawty dont trust me I break hearts often
If you look at my pockets you a weight watcher
From a dishwasher to a kingpin
Remember how the scene end and how this thing is
Drugs backed in em mean them things in
Now its duffle bags full of green men
I swear I aint lying if my daddy hadnt died
Hed tell ya I had em hooked like Kareem did
Two kids later I mature like fine wine in the basement
Vino different kind of pinot
Tried to stack cnote after cnote
Im tryna make it count like a free throw after free throw
Line its a thin one between
Getting high and committing crimes
Let a nigga live
Ive been locked up more rapping than I did tryna get a brick
Fuck this shit

I remember when I believed in me
What am I supposed to do
Uh now when the ones that didnt see me
They want a verse or two
Shit what am I supposed to do
Put em in a fucking hearse or two
Im the illest I wrote that shit in cursive too
And I smoke just to ease the pain
So hungry I used to try to eat the rain
Well at least until the pizza came
Or at least until polices came
Undercovers outside my momma yard
And all the guns is in Keshas name
In Jesuss name I pray
I say that a couple times a day
When its time to eat when its time to lay
And when its daytime it aint my time of day uh

I heard my little big cousin mad at me
I call him little big cause he younger than me
But he big he was the high school team captain
Didnt graduate but sometimes things happen
And whatever happen that was the worst day
And who know what was going on in the first place
I love and helped raise my nigga
This year forgot to call him on his birthday
Its hard to explain my new lifestyle
A partner lockdown got a phone and an iPod
He called to tell me happy new years
I had to tell him nigga its March
We had similar stars
But I aint figured his part
They had dough and we didnt
How did it dissolve alkaseltzer
This is the outroduction
Niggas stab you in your back like acupunctureYeah yeah
 Chainz
If I aint at the party

Nigga want to play around like a playground
Nigga laydown look at that trigger plate
Southside lean with the my MIWI
Started from the inside drag his ass outside
Chain so big you can see that shit from the blind side
At their neck like a bow tie Imma be a multi
Opposite of broke
You cant go where I go
Mop their ass they got a motherfucking dry floor
And I walk on a tight rope

Combine all my thoughts make my mind travel
Graduated from the streets thats beyond tassel
In my muscle car maybe we should arm wrestle
Im raw using all caps
I got A on my ballcaps
No I didnt do it but I thought about it
If I would have did it it would have chalk around
Yellow tape never hesitate
 Chainz derived from Section 
Meditate thats my stress relief
Ive been stylin on em since a lease preach

Live long enough itll happen to you
Live long
It will it will
It will it will

Live long enough itll happen to you
Live long
It will it will

My pop told me men dont cry
Then he turned around and died on me
So I didnt know what else to do
But motherfuckin cry homie
Oh yeah Im Gods son
Tell Nas he got more than one
And me I got more to see more to be
Order three started with a quarter ki
Im so ill I need penicill
Rockin ice cubes talkin kill at will
And these days you cant tell who is really real
Ridin on some Emmitt Smiths long way from Emmett Till

Live long enough itll happen to you
Live long
It will it will
It will it will

Live long enough itll happen to you
Live long
It will it will
It will it will

Streets love a nigga got a Dboy membership
We do it from the heart I hope the aunt will remember this
Coke on all sinisters cold but no fridge in this
No to all witnesses lie or die infamous
My style is so infamous my style it needs censorship
Dealer whats the business Dont call Im busy bitch
Unless you bout your business Im tryna get some benjamins
Niggas say a lie on their way to the top
But you know youre too hot when they kidnap your pops
I guess thats sayin a lot
But we aint sayin much we just sendin them shots nigga

Death over dynasty Im talkin major not the minor league
And you the last of a dyin breed
Follow caine like a menace to society
The richest nigga in the city cosignin me
My shampoo days done showed me the way
As I pray lord willin but the killers still vague
How can there be closure when the shooters still in questionin
Your niggas got rich but when you died them niggas owed you
And everything I see is adding up to what you told me
Im ramblin tryna keep it to myself
Im scramblin still hard to hold the tears back
Never saw what I became cant get them years back
Death before dishonor

Live long enough itll happen to you
Live long
It will it will
It will it will

Live long enough itll happen to you
Live long
It will it will
It will it willGood head get your rent paid
Then I cut a corner like a switch blade
Bitch made nigga talking shit about her
Got a red car so I bought a red bottom
Chillin at the game sitting courtside
Youre looking at the flyest nigga on the boat ride
Low life Im a multi nigga fo life
Oh my had it up to here like a bow tie
Cut it out sold drugs out my mommas house
So for mothers day I bought my mom a house
Chillin in the club standing on the couch
Nigga fuck yo couch nigga nigga fuck yo couch
Shoes cost more than that shit anyway
Any day when the semi spray better penetrate
Brrraaatt Better duck nigga
Got a lake in my yard filled with ducks nigga

Long ass clip I could shoot you without aiming

Because Im loyal to my soil good to my hood like oil
Got me in that water let it boil
Bitch Im a boy beat the beat up like Roy
Consider your bitch my employ
