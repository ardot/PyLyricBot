CARBON
MONOXIDE
FOR

WHO
DRAWS
THE
CROWD
WHO
PLAYS
SO
LOUD
BABY
ITS
THE
GUITAR
MAN

WHOS
GONNA
STEAL
THE
SHOW
YOU
KNOW
BABY
ITS
THE
GUITAR
MAN

HE
CAN
MAKE
YOU
LOVE
HE
CAN
MAKE
YOU
CRY

HE
WILL
BRING
YOU
DOWN
HE
WILL
GET
YOU
HIGH

AND
SOMETHING
KEEPS
HIM
GOING
MILES
AND
MILES
AWAY

TO
FIND
ANOTHER
PLACE
TO
PLAY


NIGHT
AFTER
NIGHT
WHO
TREATS
YOU
RIGHT
BABY
ITS
THE
GUITAR
MAN

WHOS
ON
THE
RADIO
YOU
KNOW
BABY
ITS
THE
GUITAR
MAN

WHEN
HE
COMES
TO
TOWN
AND
YOU
SEE
HIS
FACE

AND
YOU
THINK
YOU
MIGHT
LIKE
TO
TAKE
HIS
PLACE

SOMETHING
KEEPS
HIM
DRIFTING
MILES
AND
MILES
AWAY

SEARCHING
FOR
THE
SONGS
TO
PLAY

THEN
YOU
LISTEN
TO
THE
MUSIC
AND
YOUD
LIKE
TO
SING
ALONG

AND
YOU
WANT
TO
GET
THE
MEANING
OUT
OF
EACH
AND
EVERY
SONG

AND
YOU
FIND
YOURSELF
A
MESSAGE
AND
SOME
WORDS
TO
CALL
YOUR
OWN
AND
TAKE
EM
HOME


HE
CAN
MAKE
YOU
LOVE
HE
CAN
GET
YOU
HIGH

HE
WILL
BRING
YOU
DOWN
THEN
HELL
MAKE
MAKE
YOU
CRY

SOMETHING
KEEPS
HIM
MOVING
BUT
NO
ONE
SEEMS
TO
KNOW

WHAT
IT
IS
THAT
MAKES
HIM
GO


THEN
THE
LIGHTS
BEGIN
TO
FLICKER
AND
THE
SOUND
IS
GETTING
DIM

THE
VOICE
BEGINS
TO
FALTER
AND
THE
CROWDS
ARE
GETTING
THIN

BUT
HE
NEVER
SEEMS

SOAK
YOUR
