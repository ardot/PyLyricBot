F*cking ranches with dirty drawers 
Now don't get me wrong, don't get me wrong

Make them suck the d*ck with a blindfold 
I'm trying to win the nigga with the rhinestone

Niggas want the issue, they unload the shit 
F*ck 'em with some niggas I don't give a shit

Uh bitch, I'm yo daddy nigga, shut up!
tutterin' 
Givin'em rest and makin' love again 
In my best I be the run again 
And I have the man dem stutterin' 
I treat the label like money from my shows 
G.O.O.D. would've been God except I added more o's 
If I knew she was cheatin' I'd still've bought her more clothes 
'Cause I was too busy with my Baltimore- you know 
Some people call that the art of war you know 
I guess it depends what you fallin' for 
The clothes, cars, money, girls and the clothes 
Aw money, you sold your soul 
Nah man, mad people was frontin' 
God damn, we made something from nothing
Break records at Louie, ate breakfast at Gucci
My girl a superstar all from a home movie
Bow on our arrival - the unamerican idols
What niggas did in Paris, got em' hanging off the Eiffel
Yeah I'm talking business, we talking CIA
I'm talking George Tenet, I seen him the other day
He asked me about my Maybach, think he had the same
Except mine tinted and his might have been rented
You know white people get money don't spend it
Or maybe they get money, buy a business
I rather buy 80 gold chains and go ig'nant
I know Spike Lee gone kill me but let me finish
Blame it on the pigment, we living no limits
Them gold Master P ceilings was just a figment
Of our imagination, MTV cribs
Now I'm looking at a crib right next to where TC lives
That's Tom Cruise, whatever she accuse
He wasn't really drunk he just had a few brews
Pass the refreshments, a cool, cool beverage
Everything I do need a news crew's presence
Speedboat swerve, homie watch out for the waves
I'm way too black to burn from sun rays
So I just meditate at the home in Pompei
About how I could build a new Rome in one day
Everytime I'm in Vegas they screaming like he's Elvis
But I just wanna design hotels and nail it
Shit is real, got me feeling Israelian
Like Bar Refaeli, Gisele, nah that's Brazilian
Went through, deep depression when my momma passed
Suicide, what kinda talk is that
But I been talking to God for so long
And if you look at my life I guess he's talking back
Fucking with my clique
Lamborghini Mercy, your chick, she so thirsty
I'm in that juicy Lambo with your bitch, she tryna jerk me
Let the suicide doors up
I do suicides on the tour bus
I do suicides on the private jet
You know what that mean, I'm fly to death
I step in Def Jam building like I'm the shit
Tell 'em, "Give me fifty million or I'mma quit"
Most rappers taste level ain't at my waist level
Turn up the bass 'til it's up-in-your-face level
Don't do no press but I get the most press, kid
Plus my bitch, make your bitch look like Precious
Something about Mary, she gone off that Molly
Now the whole party is melted like Dali
Now everybody is movin' they body
Don't sell me apartment, I'll move in the lobby
Niggas is loiterin' just to feel important
You gon' see lawyers and niggas in Jordan's
Well! It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth
It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth
When it comes to my sound which is the champion sound
Believe! Believe!
Now hold up, I ain't trying to stunt, man
But these new Yeezys jumped over the Jumpman
Went from most hated to the god flow
I guess that's a feeling only me and Lebron know
I'm living three dreams:
Biggie Smalls', Dr. King's, Rodney King's
Cuz we can't get along, no resolution
Till we drown all these haters, rest in peace to Whitney Houston
Cars, money, girls and the clothes
Aww money, you sold your soul
Naww man, mad people was frontin'
God damn, we made it here from nothing
Picture work your whole life, and you can't cut through
That can mess up your whole life, like an uncle that touched you
What has the world come to, I'm from the 312
Where cops don't come through and dreams don't come true
Like "Where did God go?" In his Murcielago
Went from working McDonalds, barely paying the car note
Even got enough to get his mama a condo
People came shot him down in front of his mom
40 killings in a weekend, 40 killings in a week
Man the summer too hot you can feel it in the street
Welcome to Sunday service if you feel your Sunday service
I got green in my eyes, follow this Erick Sermon
Did Moses not part the water with the cane?
Did heavens not make an ark when I made it rain?
Did Yeezy not get signed by Hov and Dame?
And went to Jacob and made the new Jesus chains?
In Jesus name, let the choir say
"I'm on fire ay," that's what Richard Prior say
And I annihilate anybody that violate
Ask any dope boy you know, they admire Ye'
Can't a young nigga get money anymore?
Tell PETA my mink is draggin' on the floor
Can I have a bad bitch wit'out no flaws
Come to meet me wit'out no drawers?
Dinner with Anna Wintour, racin' wit' Anja Rubik
I told you ma'fuckers it was more than the music
In the projects one day to Project Runway
We done heard all that loud-ass talkin', we used to it
I'm from where shorties fucked up, double-cupped up
Might even kill somebody and YouTube it
So whoever think they words affect me is too stupid
And if you could do it better than me, then you do it
We flyer than the parakeet, floatin' wit' no parachute
Six thousand-dollar pair of shoes, we made it to the Paris news!
Don't talk about style, 'cause I embarrass you
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me 'fore I embarrass you

Can't a young nigga get money anymore?
Tell PETA my mink is draggin' on the floor
Can I have a bad bitch wit'out no flaws
Come to meet me wit'out no drawers?
And the whole industry wanna fuck yo' old chick
Only nigga I got respect for is Wiz
And I'll admit, I fell in love with Kim
'Round the same time she had fell in love wit' him
Well, that's cool, baby girl, do ya thing
Lucky I ain't have Jay drop 'I'm from the team
La familia, Roc Nation
We in the buildin', but still keep it basement
Flyer than the parakeet, floatin' wit' no parachute
Six thousand-dollar pair of shoes, I made it to the Paris news
Don't talk about style, 'cause I embarrass you
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me 'fore I embarrassed you
G.O.O.D. Music, we fresh, we fresh
Anything else, we detest, detest
Bitch-ass niggas got ass and breasts
All that said, lemme ask this quest'

Can't a young nigga get money anymore?
Tell PETA my mink is draggin' on the floor
Can I have a bad bitch wit'out no flaws
Come to meet me wit'out...

Don't talk to me 'bout style, nigga, I'll ma'fuckin' embarrass you
Talkin' 'bout clothes, I'll ma'fuckin' embarrass you
Hollin' 'bout some hoes, I'll ma'fuckin' embarrass you
Way too cold, I promise you'll need some Theraflu
Mmm ain't this some shit? Pulled up in the A-V-entador
And the doors, raise up, like praise the Lord
Did the fashion show, and a tour, and a movie, and a score
This a ghetto opera, Francis Ford Car Coppola
I need a new crib to hold my plaques, Rick Ross had told me that
Said I'd be all up in Goldman Sachs
Like, "These niggas tryna hold me back
These niggas tryna hold me back", I'm just trying to protect my stacks
Mitt Romney don't pay no tax, Mitt Romney don't pay no tax
Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back, Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back
Only nigga in Beverly Hills, where the hell is Axle Foley at?
"Ease up there baby boy", Ving Rhames told Jody that
R. Kelly and the God of rap
Shitting on you, holy crap
I'm the one, baby
Yeah, I'm the one, baby
Since God gave his only begotten son, baby
It's hard preachin' the gospel to the slums lately
So I had to put the church on the drums, baby
You on a run, baby
You on a run, baby
You think you free but you a slave to the funds, baby
You think you me, but you ain't me, what you done lately?
Mmhm that's cool but I been runnin on the sun, baby
We on a galaxy that haters cannot visit
That's my reality so get off my Scott Disick
If you ever held a title belt you would know how Michael felt
Tyson, Jackson, Jordan – Michael Phelps
Yeahhh, had to take it to another 'round
Cause everything around me got me underwhelmed
Best way to describe my position is at the helm
Best way to describe my new whip – Yeeeaaaalmmm
They smile in my face is what I don't like
They steal your whole sound that's a soundbite
The media crucify me like they did Christ
They want to find me not breathin' like they found Mike
A girl'll run her mouth only out of spite
But I never hit a woman never in my life
I was in too deep like Mekhi Phife
In that pussy so deep I could have drowned twice
Rose gold Jesus piece with the brown ice
Eatin' good, vegetarian with the brown rice
Girls kissin' girls- cuz' it's hot right?
But unless they use a strap-on then they not dykes
They ain't about that life, they ain't about that life
We hangin' out that window it's about to be a Suge night
Free Bump J, real nigga for life
Shoutout to Derrick Rose, man that nigga nice
Shout out to L-E-P, J Boogie right?
Chief Keef, King Louis, this is Chi, right?
