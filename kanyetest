 Fresh air rolling down the window
 Too many Urkels on your team thats why your wins low
 Dont make me pull the toys out huh

 And moved her back in Paris

 And my eyes more red than the devil is
 And Im bout to take it to another level bitch
 There you go again aint nobody as cold as this
 Do the rap and the track tripled up and no assist
 But my only focus is staying on some bogus sh-t
 Argue with my older bitch acting like I owe her sh-t
 I heard the people sayin raps are gettin trap mayne
 Bought the chain that always give me back pain
 F-ckin up my money so yeh I had to act sane
 Chi n-gga but hes hold of his accent
 I love it though
 I love it though
 Uh put your hands to the constellations
 They way you look should be a sin you my sensation
 I know Im preaching to the congregation
 We love Jesus but she done learned a lot from Satan
 May the Lord forgive us
 May the Gods be with us
 And that magic hour I seen good christians make rrash decisions
 Oh she do it what happened to Religion
 Oh she lose it
 She putting on her make up
 She casually allure
 Text message break up the casualty of tour
 How she gone wake up and not love me no more
 I thought I was the ass hole I guess its rubbing off
 Hood phenomenom the Lebron of rhyme
 Hard to be humble when you stuntin on a jumbotron
 Im looking at her like this what you really want it huh
 What we argue anyway oh I forgot its summertime
 When the sun go down its the magic hour
 The magic hour
 And outta all the colours that are still up the skies
 You got green on your mind
 I can see it in your eyes
 Why you standing there with your face screwed up
 Dont leave while your hot thats how Mase screwed up
 Throwing sh-t around I hope place screwed up
 Maybe I should call Mase so that he could pray for us
 Or hit the Jamaica spot at the bar take a seat
 I ordered your jerk she said you are what you eat
 You see I always loved your sense of humour
 But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
 The Lyor Cohen or Dior Homme thats Dior Homme not Dior homie
 The crib scarface couldnt be more Tony
 You love me for me could you be more phoney
 A little sugar honey suckle lamb
 Great expression of happiness
 Boy you could not miss with a dozen roses
 Such would astound you
 The joy of children laughing around you
 These are the makings of you
 It is true the makings of you oh
 I do it for the fore-fathers and the street authors
 That are not A&Rs in the cheap office
 Rappers that never got signed but they keep offers
 Girls thats way too fine for us to keep off us
 Gave her a handshake only for my mans sake
 She in her birthday suit cause of the damn cake
 Now theres crumbs all over the damn place
 And she want me to cum all over her damn face
 I never understood planned parenthood
 Cause I never met nobody plan to be a parent in the hood
 Taking refills of that plan B pill
 Another shorty that wont make it to the family will
 If I dont make it cant take it hope the family will
 They aint crazy they dont know how insanity feel
 Don C just had a shorty so its not that bad
 But I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had
 No Electro no metro a little retro I perfecto
 You know the demo ya boy act wild
 You aint get the memo Yeezys back in style
 Now when Rome go Gidget the other got Bridget
 Whats more tripped out though is they sisters
 Nah you aint listen they black they sisters

 So next time you see me on your fallopian
 Though the Jewelrys Egytian know the hungers Ethiopian
 Stupid questions like Is he gon be dope again

 This beat deserves Hennessy a bad bitch and a bag of weed the Holy Trinity
 In the mirror where I see my only enemy
 Your lifes cursed well mines an obscenity
 This is my momma sh-t
 I used to hear this through the walls in the hood when I was back in my pyjama sh-t
 Afros and marijuana sticks seeds and the ganja hat will be popping like the sample that Im rhyming with
 Pete Rock let the needle drop
 I seen so much as a kid they surprised I dont needle pop
 Taking sips of pop six packs of millanips
 Pink champel Valentine L
 Ballys on my feet help me balance out well
 That and the sh-t I used to balance on the scale
 I got it honest from the parties from my mommas
 Virgin Marys try to judge her Im like where the Madonnas now
 Give all glory to Gloria they said you raised that boy too fast but you was raising a warrior
 We victorious theyll never take the joy from us
 Im so appalled
 I fall then ball
 Balled in and Donald Trump taking dollars from yall
 Baby your fire and your girlfriend is higha
 And if you dont mind Im gonna On call
 We are but a law we dont give a fuck by yall
 Like the dogs that chew a fuckin hole through the wall
 But since they all lovers
 I need more rubbers
 And if I dont use rubbers need more covers
 House keeping I mean gawd damn one time
 Let it be a bad bitch sweeping
 That know we get Os like Cheerios

 Praises due to the most high Allah
 Praises due to the most fly Prada

Niggas be writin bullshit like they gotta work

Champagne wishes 30 white bitches

My name on the highlines
Written across your skylines
Lookin out my rolly
Motha fucka its my time
By the way what a way to act with the
We the black dystany
These the days of our lives
Hating from the sidelines
Giving you the guidelines
On a bathroom wall I wrote
Id rather argue with you than to be with someone else else else else
I took a piss and dismiss it and went and found somebody else
Arguing harvesting the feelings Id rather be by my f-cking self
Till about 2am and I call back and I hang up and start to blame myself
Somebody help
You werent perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom gripping you up and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do
I know you aint getting this type of d-ck from that local dude
And if you are I hope you are have a good time
Cause I definitely be having mine

And you aint finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other n-ggas stroking you
Might say I hit you
He sitting there consoling you
Threw the money threw the mud
Whos provoking you
You should be grateful a n-gga like me even knows you
Now you noticeable and cant nobody can control you
1am and cant nobody get a hold of you
Im calling your brothers phone like what was I supposed to do
Even though I knew he never told the truth
He was just gon say whatever you gon told him too
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Chuck dirt on eachother like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
Dat aint right girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said Yeezy I aint youre right girl
Probably find one of them I like art type girls
All of the lights she was caught in the hype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with the lights
And who to blame you to blame me to blame
For the pain and it poured everytime it rained
Lets play the blame game
Things used to be now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
Weve become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gon for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything how do we leave with nothing
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely
Lets play the blame game I love you more
Lets play the blame game for sure
Lets call her names names I hate you more
Lets call her names names for sure
nd I know that you are somehwere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
You aint pick up but your phone accidently called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing the whole thing the whole thing
Now imma need you to kill the hypocrisy this an aristocracy 
Im Socrates but my skin more chocolaty 
whats up wooo thats old news 
Im in a speed boat in my boat shoes 
Ha 
I swear my whole collection so cruise 
I might walk in nobu with no shoes 
He just walked in nobu like it was wholefoods 
That nigger crazy I told you 
Immatue adult insecure asshole What else 
If you fall on the concrete thats your asphalt 
If you pass on that Kane beat thats your last thought 
Get what you ask for I swear thats your ass thought 
She got a big booty but she couldnt drop that ass low 
So you take your last hoe and rope up all the cash flow 
When you getting money they be all up on your ass yo 
When you getting money cuts dont matter cus a nigger past go 
Straight to jail yo in a hell hole 
Right next to lucifer tell him I said hello 
Ask if imma be there soon and tell him I said hell no 
Poor the champagne let your watch show 
Shortie got a man watch wrist look colossal 
I admit my first watch was a fossil 
Now Im in the louvre looking for fossils 
Attention to detail is so uncanny 
And the whips on this is so uncamrie 
Somebody needs to put us on camera 
The world of rollies and everyones family 
Stay jordan fresh suites and ferraris coupes 
N shortie watch barneys we head the barneys 
End up at mani giorgi and service from sergio pacini 
Lamborghini the chain blow off the vertigo 
I know the flow just hit a hella-fied vertical 
This the cris year last year was magic 32 
Lyricaly cant none of yall murder Ye 
Cus yall raps aint got no vertebrae 
I got style ask julie she heard in may 
I killt the fur last Paris rasied the murder rate 
FIrst of all we all know the beats is 
Like a mix between fergie and jeez 
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception 
Everyone of his majestys swim partys is pageantrys 
Cannon ball of the diving board when I am bored 
All my hommies GDs but I am lord 
Rap god Greek mythology 
And this life to crazy to think logicaly 
Heres somthing that you can use an analogy 
My life is like a childs solutions become reality 
He walked in our lives 
I was only five 
Superman pajamas I was super duper fly 
Sitting here like why he at least supersize 
You know I scrutinise like who this newer guy 
Im my mama boyfriend Im her little husband 
I was the man of the house when there wasnt 
Trying to get to know homie just kill the charm 
You aint interested in me you just tryna f-ck my mum 
We are the voices of our parents bad choices 
The aftermath of divorces 
The kids of bitter split ups 
And baby sitters 
Grand parents that dont know what to do with us 
And the last thing I want to see is mamas new n-gga 
You old Old Spice wearing 
Short chain wearing 
Dress shoes and jogging pants wearing 
Church sock wearing 
When you first stop caring about your appearance 
When you get here anyway I already got parents 
Dont try to put me inline I already got crayons 
My mama said I could do it I already got clearance 
Keep your hands of my mama how I need to got clearance 
Yeah I know she look good but you need to stop staring 
I drew a picture of her that would make her proud 
But the door was locked and the TV up so loud 
I scream out I aint going to sleep no time soon 
And when I do Im sleeping in my mama room
I dont like you n-gga 
If I was old enough I would fight you n-gga 
I wanna run over you in my bike you n-gga 
Dont go to sleep at night you n-gga
And it seems like I wasted time 
If thats what its all about 
Mama if thats moving up than I 
When I become my mamas boyfriends 
Twenty years later where has the time gone 
Now you see Im dating having problems of my own 
Now that Im grown the tables turned around 
I never thought Id ever raise another n-ggas child 
He dont like his mamas boyfriend 
Just like me dont wanna do the wrong thing 
Thats very un Spike Lee but he be like he go round his mama then 
Cause when she here he be quiet 
When she leave he be talking again 
He be wylin again 
Be calm I dont drink the drama 
A sip of Dom Tyler-Perry-on 
You gon marry my mom look 
I dont read palms and I dont read psalms 
And I did take little man to church 
And took little man to school 
Look littl eman kids dont make the rules 
Even though I aint raised you 
You your mama angel 
Dont get it twisted baby boy Ill Ving Rhames you 
Something wrong
I hold my head
MJ gone our n-gga dead
I slapped my girl she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
Im heading home Im almost there
Im on my way heading up the stairs
To my surprise a n-gga replacing me
I had to take em to that ghetto university
Restraining order
Cant see my daughter
Her mother brother grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation
We met at Borders
Told her she take me back
Ill be more supportive
I made mistakes
I bump my head
Courts suck me dry
I spent that bread
She need a daddy
Baby please cant let her grow up in that ghetto university
Us living as we do upside-down
And the new words of hell is revolution
People dont even want to hear the preachers spill or squeal
Because Gods hole card has been thoroughly peaked
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey
The Youngsters who were programmed to continue fucking up
Woke up one night digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys
America stripped from bed and we have not all yet closed our eyes
The signs of truth were tattooed across our au-the-ne-tic vagina
We learned to our amazement the untold tale of scandal
Two long centuries burried in a rusty vault hosed down daily with gagging perfume
America was a bastard the illegitimate daughter of the mother country whose legs were then spread around the world and a rapist known as freedom freedoom
Democracy liberty and justice were revolutionary code names that proceeded the bubbling x4
In the mother countrys crotch
What does Webster say about soul
All I want is a good home and a wife and a children
And some food to feed them every night
After all is said and done
Build a new route to China if theyll have you
Who will survive in America [x4]

She learning a new word its yacht
Blew the World up as soon as I hit the club with her
Too Short called told me I fell in love with her
Seen by actors ball players and drug dealers
And some lesbians that never loved n-ggas
Twisted love story True Romance
Mary Magdalene from a pole dance

She has no idea what shes doing in college
That major that she majored in dont make no money
But she wont drop out her parents will look at her funny
Now tell me that aint insecure
The concept of school seems so secure
Sophomore three years aint picked a career
She like fuck it Ill just stay down here and do hair
Cause thats enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby daddy dont really care
Shes so precious with the peer pressure
Couldnt afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus a Lexus
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you cant believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well
Uh and when it falls down who you gon call now
Cmon cmon and when it falls down

Thats why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas they done drove me crazy
I cant even pronounce nothing pass that versace
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like nigga you aint up on this
And I cant even go to the grocery store
Without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the American dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us floss cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper look how low we astoop
Even if you in a Benz you still a nigga in a coupe
Uh and when it falls down who you gon call now
Cmon cmon and when it falls down
I say fuck the police thats how I treat em
We buy our way out of jail but we cant buy freedom
Well buy a lot of clothes but we dont really need em
The things we buy to cover up whats inside
Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
Thats why shorties holler Where the ballers at
Drug dealers buy Jordans crackheads buy crack
But the white man get paid off of all a dat
But I aint even gon act holier than thou
Cause fuck it I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and Id do it again
Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz
I wanna act ballerific like its all terrific
I got a couple past due bills I wont get specific
I got a problem with spending before I get it
We all self conscious Im just the first to admit it

Brains power and muscle like Dame Puffy and Russell 
Your boy back on his hustle dont know you dont discuss you 
Every rapper want to know when they can get to work 
Every stylist want to know where they can get the shirts 
Everybody ripping my style like the shit that hurts 
But they dont give me my credit thats the shit that hurts 
Theres something I might say Theres something I might play 
A beat I might make might make they life change 
And save their whole deal Their wrist is on chill

Never did this before thats what the virgin says
Weve been generally warned thats what the surgeon says
God talk to me now this is an emergency
And she claim she only with me for the currency
You cut me deep bitch cut me like surgery
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurting me
Id never do that to you at least purposely
We breaking up again we making up again
But we dont love no more I guess we fucking then
Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her
And you mix them emotions with tequila
And you mix that with a little bad advice
On one of them bad nights yall have a bad fight
And you talking bout her family her aunts and shit
And she say Motherfucker yo mommas a bitch
You know domestic drama and shit all that attitude
Ill never hit a girl but Ill shake the shit outta you
But Imma be the bigger man Big Pimpin like Jiggaman
Oh I guess I figure its
See what I want so much should never hurt this bad
Never did this before thats what the virgin says
Weve been generally warned thats what the surgeon says
God talk to me now this is an emergency
And my nigga said I shouldnt let it worry me
I need to focus on the girls we getting currently
But I been thinking and it got me back to sinking and
This relationship it even got me back to drinking all this
Hennessy
Its gonna be the death of me
And I always thought that you having my child was our destiny
But I cant even vibe with you sexually
Cuz every time I would try you would question me
Saying You fucking them girls disrespecting me
You dont see how ya lies is affecting me
You dont see how our life was supposed to be
And I never let a nigga get that close to me
And you aint cracked up to what you was supposed to be
You always gone youll always be where them hoesll be
And this the first time she ever spilled her soul to me
I fucked up and I know it g
I guess its bittersweet poetry
See what I want so much should never hurt this bad
Never did this before thats what the virgin says
Weve been generally warned thats what the surgeon says
God talk to me now this is an emergency
From my theme song
My leather black jeans on
My by any means on
Pardon me gettin my scream on
Enter the kingdom
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
And at the top door they gon come at you King Kong
Middle America packed in
Came to see me in my black skin
My homey was number one draft pick
They slip on his jersey and act rich
If I dont get ran out by Catholics
Here come some conservative Baptists
Sayin he overreactin
Like them black kids in Chiraq bitch
4in the morning and Im zonin
They say Im possessed its an omen
I keep it 300 like the Romans
300 bitches wheres the trojans
Picture me livin in the moment
And Ive been a menace for the longest
Picture me livin in the moment
Picture me livin in the moment
So follow me up cause this shits about to go down
Im doin 500 Im outta control now
But theres nowhere to go now
And theres no way to slow down
Runnin out of time - moving fast
So just close your eyes and then enjoy this crash
4 in the mornin and Im zonin
Think Im possessed its an omen
I keep it 300 like the Romans
300 girls theyre the chosen
Baby we livin in the moment
Ive been a menace for the longest
But I aint finished Im devoted

 Lets play the blame game I love you more

 At the end of it you know we both were wrong
 But I love to play the blame game I love you more
 Lets play the blame game for sure
 Lets call her names names I hate you more
 Lets call her names names for sure
 On a bathroom wall I wrote
 Id rather argue with you than to be with someone else else else else
 I took a piss and dismiss it and went and found somebody else
 Arguing harvesting the feelings Id rather be by my f-cking self
 Till about 2am and I call back and I hang up and start to blame myself
 Somebody help
 You werent perfect but you made life worth it
 Stick around real feelings might surface
 Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom gripping you up and choking you
 What the hell was I supposed to do
 I know you aint getting this type of d-ck from that local dude
 And if you are I hope you are have a good time
 Cause I definitely be having mine
 And you aint finna see a mogul get emotional
 Every time I hear bout other n-ggas stroking you
 Might say I hit you
 He sitting there consoling you
 Threw the money threw the mud
 Whos provoking you
 You should be grateful a n-gga like me even knows you
 Now you noticeable and cant nobody can control you
 1am and cant nobody get a hold of you
 Im calling your brothers phone like what was I supposed to do
 Even though I knew he never told the truth
 He was just gon say whatever you gon told him too
 At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
 Chuck dirt on eachother like mud wrestlers
 I heard he bought some coke with my money
 Dat aint right girl
 You getting blackmailed for that white girl
 You always said Yeezy I aint youre right girl
 Probably find one of them I like art type girls
 All of the lights she was caught in the hype girl
 And I was satisfied being in love with the lights
 And who to blame you to blame me to blame
 For the pain and it poured everytime it rained
 Lets play the blame game
 Things used to be now they not
 Anything but us is who we are
 Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
 Weve become public enemies
 We walk away like strangers in the street
 Gon for eternity
 We erased one another
 So far from where we came
 With so much of everything how do we leave with nothing
 Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
 Hatred and attitude tear us entirely
 And I know that you are somehwere doing your thing
 And when the phone called it just ring and ring
 You aint pick up but your phone accidently called me back
 And I heard the whole thing
 I heard the whole thing the whole thing the whole thing
 Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees
 Blood on the leaves
 I just need to clear my mind now
 Its been racin since the summertime
 And Im holdin down the summer now
 And all I want is what I cant buy now
 Cause I aint got the money on me right now
 And I told you to wait
 Yeah I told you to wait
 So Imma need a little more time now
 Cause I aint got the money on me right now
 And I thought you could wait
 Yeah I thought you could wait
 These bitches surroundin me
 All want somethin out me
 Then they talk about me
 Would be lost without me
 We couldve been somebody
 Thought youd be different bout it
 Now I know you not it
 So lets get on with it
 We couldve been somebody
 Stead you had to tell somebody
 Lets take it back to the first party
 When you tried your first molly
 And came out of your body
 And came out of your body
 Running naked down the lobby
 And you was screamin that you love me
 Before the limelight tore ya
 Before the limelight stole ya
 Remember we were so young
 When I would hold you
 Before the glory
 I know there aint wrong with me
 Something strange is happening
 You couldve been somethin
 We couldve ugh we couldve been somebody
 Or was it all our first party
 When we tried our first molly
 And came out of our body
 And came out of our body
 Before they call lawyers
 Before you tried to destroy us
 How you gon lie to the lawyers
 Its like I dont even know ya
 I gotta bring it back to the Nol
 Fuck them other niggas cause Im down with my niggas
 Fuck them other niggas cause Im down with my niggas
 Fuck them other niggas cause Im down with my niggas

 She Instagram herself like #BadBitchAlert
 He Instagram his watch like #MadRichAlert
 He only wanna see that ass in reverse
 Two-thousand-dollar bag with no cash in your purse
 Now you sittin courtside wifey on the other side
 Gotta keep em separated I call that apartheid
 Then she said she impregnated thats the night your heart died
 Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that
 Main reason cause your pastor said you cant abort that
 Now your driver say that new Benz you cant afford that
 All that cocaine on the table you cant snort that
 That going to that owing money that the court got
 On and on that alimony uh yeah-yeah she got you homie
 Til death but do your part unholy matrimony
 Yeezy season approaching
 Fuck whatever yall been hearing
 Fuck what fuck whatever yall been wearing
 The monster about to come alive again
 Soon as I pull up and park the Benz
 We get this bitch shaking like Parkinsons
 Take my number and lock it in
 Indian hair no moccasins
 Its too many hoes in this house of sin
 Real nigga back in the house again
 Black Timbs all on your couch again
 Black dick all in your spouse again
 And I know she like chocolate men
 She got more niggas off than Cochran Huh
 How much you wanna give a fuck
 Let me show you right now before you give it up
 How much do I not give a fuck
 Let me show you right now before you give it up
 Hell give us what we need
 It may not be what we want
 Baby girl tryna get a nut
 And her girl tryna give it up
 Chopped em both down
 Dont judge em Joe Brown
 One last announcement
 No sports bra lets keep it bouncin
 Everybody tryna live at the top of the mountain
 Took her to the peak she tried to sip the fountain
 That when David Grutman kicked her out
 But I got to fucking put my dick in her mouth
 White slut bitch call me Elvis
 Another bitch she call me selfish
 Success got them jealous
 Shortys killin Im ridin Im drillin
 Tattoos Imma break the news
 It was real [] major moves
 Last night my bitches came in twos
 And they both suck like they came to lose
 Dropped out the first day of school
 Cause niggas had cocaine to move

 Killin them [] pain improve
 We can send this bitch up it cant go down
 This the greatest shit in the club
 Since In the club
 Its so packed I might ride around
 With no bodyguard back like Prince in the club
 She say Can you get my friends in the club
 I say Can you get my Benz in the club
 If not treat your friends like my Benz
 Park they ass outside til the evening end
 When I go raw I like to leave it in
 When I wake up I like to go again
 When I go to work she gotta call it in
 She cant go to work same clothes again
 And her heart colder than the souls of men
 Louboutin on her toes again
 Tight dress []
 Yeezus just rose again
 I can hold my liquor
 But this man canâ€™t handle his weed
 Dark and lonely now
 On Chicago south of town
 Im on to Indiana
 I heard it in the radio now
 I cant handle no liquor
 But these bitches cant handle me
 I cant control my niggas
 And my niggas they cant control me
 You say you know me my nigga
 But you really just know the old me
Bitch Im back out my coma
Waking up on your sofa
When I park my Range Rover
Slightly scratch your Corolla
Okay I smashed your Corolla

Five years we been over

 Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
 Doing clothes you would have thought I had help
 But they wasnt satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself

Put my fist in her like a civil rights sign
And grabbed it with a slight grind
And held it til the right time

Uh Im so scared of my demons
Uh I go to sleep with a nightlight
Uh my mind move like a Tron bike
Uh pop a wheelie on the Zeitgeist
Uh Im finna start a new movement
Uh being led by the drums
Uh Im a rap-lic priest
Uh getting head by the nuns
Uh they dont play what Im playing
Uh they dont see what Im saying
Uh they be balling in the D-League
Uh I be speaking Swaghili
